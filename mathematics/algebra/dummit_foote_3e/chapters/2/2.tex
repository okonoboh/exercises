                  $C_G(A) = \{g \in G : g^{-1}ag = a \text{ for all } a\in A\}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} We have that
      \begin{align*}
         g \in C_G(A) &\Longleftrightarrow gag^{-1}=a \text{ for all } a\in A \\

   \item[2.2.2]   Prove that $C_G(Z(G)) = G$ and deduce that $N_G(Z(G)) = G$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Clearly $C_G(Z(G)) \subseteq G$, so it suffices to show
      that containment in the other direction. Now let $g \in G$ and
      $z \in Z(G)$. Since $z$ is in the center of $G$, it follows that
      $zg = gz$, so that $g$ commutes with every element of $Z(G)$; that is,
      $g \in C_G(Z(G))$ and we can conclude that $G \subseteq C_G(Z(G))$. Since
      $$G = C_G(Z(G)) \subseteq N_G(Z(G)) \subseteq G,$$
      it follows that $N_G(Z(G)) = G$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.2.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.2.3]   Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $G$ with
                  $A \subseteq B$ then $C_G(B)$ is a subgroup of $C_G(A)$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $A \subseteq B \subseteq G$, with
      $A \neq \emptyset$. By the discussion on Page 49 of the textbook, we know
      that $C_G(B) \le G$ and $C_G(A) \le G$. Since $A \subseteq B$, it follows
      that every element $g \in G$ that commutes with all elements in $B$ must
      necessarily commute with all elements in $A$; thus
      $C_G(B) \subseteq C_G(A)$, so that $C_G(B) \le C_G(A)$. \qed

                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item $G = S_3$ and $A = $ \{1, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)\}.
                     \item $G = D_8$ and $A = \{1, s, r^2, sr^2\}$.
                     \item $G = D_{10}$ and $A = \{1, r, r^2, r^3, r^4\}$.
                  \end{enumerate}
      
      \textbf{Solution.}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item The set $A$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$ since $A$ is generated by
               (1 2 3). Thus $A \le C_G(A)$, so that $|C_G(A)| \ge 3$. By
               Lagrange's Theorem, it follows that $|C_G(A)| = 3$ or 6. Since
               (1 3) does not commute with (1 2 3), it follows that
               $|C_G(A)| = 3$, so that $A = C_G(A)$. We know that
               $A \le N_G(A)$, so we have to check if the other elements of $G$
               normalize $A$. Thus
               \begin{align*}
                  (1\;2)A(1\;2)^{-1} &= (1\;2)A(1\;2) \\
                     &= \{(1\;2)(1)(1\;2), (1\;2)(1\;2\;3)(1\;2),
                          (1\;2)(1\;3\;2)(1\;2)\} \\
                     &= \{(1), (1\;3\;2), (1\;2\;3)\} \\
                     &= A.
               \end{align*}
               
               This says that (1 2) $\in N_G(A)$ so that $|N_G(A)| \ge 4$. But
               $|N_G(A)| = 3$ or 6 by Lagrange's Theorem; thus $N_G(A) = G$.
         \item Using Exercise 2.2.4, we have that
               $C_G(A) = C_G(1) \cap C_G(s) \cap C_G(r^2) \cap C_G(sr^2) = A$.
               Since $C_G(A) \le N_G(A)$, we have that $|N_G(A)| \ge 4$. Now
               $|N_G(A)| = 4$ or 8 according to Lagrange's Theorem. Since $r$
               does not commute with $s$, it follows that $r \notin N_G(A)$.
               That is $|N_G(A)| = 4$, so that $N_G(A) = G$.
         \item The set $A$ is the cyclic subgroup of rotations of $G$, so
               $|C_G(A)| \ge 5$. Since $r$ does not commute with $s$, it follows
               that $r \notin C_G(A)$; thus $|C_G(A)| = 5$ by Lagrange's
               Theorem. Note that $N_G(A) \ge 5$ since $C_G(A) \le N_G(A)$; so
               since
               \begin{align*}
                  sA^s{-1} &= sAs \\
                     &= \{s1s, srs, sr^2s, sr^3s, sr^4s\} \\
                     &= \{s^2, s^2r^{-1}, s^2r^{-2}, s^2r^{-3}, s^2r^{-4}\} \\
                     &= \{1, r^4, r^3, r^2, r^1\} \\
                     &= A,
               \end{align*}
               it follows that $s \in N_G(A)$, and we have that
               $|N_G(A)| \ge 6$. Thus $|N_G(A)| = 10$ by Lagrange's Theorem and
               we can conclude that $N_G(A) = G$.

                  coefficients in the independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$,
                  $x_4$, i.e., the members of $R$ are finite sums of elements of
                  the form ${ax_1}^{r_1}{x_2}^{r_2}{x_3}^{r_3}{x_4}^{r_4}$,
                  where $a$ is any integer $r_1, \ldots, r_4$ are nonnegative
                  integers. For example,

                  \begin{equation} \label{2_2_12_1}
                     12{x_1}^5{x_2}^7x_4 - 18{x_2}^3x_3 +
                        11{x_1}^6x_2{x_3}^3{x_4}^{23}
                  \end{equation}

                  is a typical element of $R$. Each $\sigma \in S_4$ gives a
                  permutation of $\{x_1, \ldots, x_4\}$ by defining
                  $\sigma \cdot x_i = x_{\sigma(i)}$. This may be extended to a
                  map from $R$ to $R$ by defining
                  $$\sigma \cdot p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = p(x_{\sigma(1)},
                    x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}, x_{\sigma(4)})$$
                  for all $p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in R$ (i.e., $\sigma$ simply
                  permutes the indices of the variables). For example, if
                  $\sigma =$(1 2)(3 4) and $p(x_1, \ldots, x_4)$ is the
                  polynomial in \eqref{2_2_12_1} above, then

                  \begin{align*}
