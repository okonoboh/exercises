      \textbf{Solution.} Since the positive divisors of 45 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15,
      and 45, it follows that the subgroups of $Z_{45}$ are

                  that this result need not be true if $G$ is an infinite group.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $G$ be a finite group, so that $|G| = n \in \Z^+$.
      Suppose that there exists $x \in G$ such that $|x| = n$. Clearly
      $\cyc{x} \subseteq G$. But $|\cyc{x}| = n$ since $|x| = n$; thus
      $G \subseteq \cyc{x}$ so that $G = \cyc{x}$. Now let $G = \Z$. We have

                  $\varphi_a$ defined by $\varphi_a : \overline{1} \mapsto x^a$
                  extend to an \textit{isomorphism} from $\Z/48\Z$ onto
                  $Z_{48}$.
                  
      \textbf{Solution.} Suppose that $(a, 48) = 1$. Then it follows that $x^a$
      generates $Z_{48}$. Thus $\varphi_a$ is an isomorphism by Theorem 4 (Page
      56). Now suppose that $a$ is not relatively prime to 48. Then $x^a$ does
      not generate $Z_{48}$, so that the image of $\varphi_a$ is not $Z_{48}$.
      Hence $\varphi_a$ is an isomorphism if and only if $(a, 48) = 1$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.9]   Let $Z_{36} = \cyc{x}$. For which integers $a$ does the map
                  $\psi_a$ defined by $\psi_a : \overline{1} \mapsto x^a$ extend
                  to a \textit{well defined homomorphism} from $\Z/48\Z$ into
                  $Z_{36}$. Can $\psi_a$ ever be a surjective homomorphism?
                  
      \textbf{Solution.} First we shall find the restriction(s) on $a$ such that
      $\psi_a$ is well defined. Suppose $b = c$ for some $b, c \in \Z/48\Z$. It
      suffices to show that $\psi_a(b) = \psi_a(c)$. Since $b = c$, there exists
      an integer $k$ such that $b = c + 48k$. Thus $\psi_a(b) = \psi_a(c+48k)$,
      so that
      $\psi_a(b)=(x^a)^{c+48k}=x^{ac + 48ak}= x^{ac}x^{48ak}=\psi_a(c)x^{12ak}$.
      So we must require $x^{12ak} = 1$ for all $k \in \Z$. Now $x^{12ak} = 1$
      for all $k \in \Z$ if and only if $3 \mid a$ if and only if $\psi_a$ is
      well defined. It follows immediately that
      $\psi_a$ is an homomorphism since
      \begin{align*}
         \psi_a(p + q) &= (x^a)^{p+q} \\
            &= x^{ap+aq} \\
            &= x^{ap}x^{aq} \\
            &= (x^a)^p(x^a)^q \\
            &= \psi_a(p)\psi_a(q)
      \end{align*}      
      for all $p, q \in \Z/48\Z$.
      
      \textit{Can $\psi_a$ ever be a surjective homomorphism?} No!
      
      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose to the contrary that $\psi_a$ is surjective. Then
      there exists $y \in \Z/48\Z$ such that $\psi_a(y) = x$. That is
      $x^{ay} = x$, so that $x^{ay-1} = 1$; thus $ay - 1 = 36m$ for some integer
      $m$. Rearrange the equality $ay - 1 = 36m$ to get $1 = ay - 36m$. Recall
      that $3 \mid a$; since $3$ also divides 36, it follows that 3 must divide
      1, a contradiction. Thus $\psi_a$ can never be surjective. \qed

      \textbf{Solution.} In $D_8$, only $r$ and $r^4$ have order 4. Thus
      $\{1, r, r^2, r^3\}$ is the only cyclic subgroup of order 4. The trivial
      subgroup is the only cyclic subgroup of order 1. Finally there are 5
      cyclic subgroups of order 2 and they are of the form $\{1, x\}$ where

                     \item $Z_2 \times Z_2$
                     \item $Z_2 \times \Z$
                     \item $\Z \times \Z$.
                  \end{enumerate}
      
      \textbf{Proof.}
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item The order of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ is 4, but no element in this group
               has order 4; thus $Z_2 \times Z_2$ is not cyclic.
         \item Let $Z_2 = \cyc{x}$. Observe that $Z_2 \times \Z$ is not finite,
               so in order for it to be cyclic it must be isomorphic to $\Z$.
               But this is not the case since $Z_2 \times \Z$ has two elements
               of finite order(namely $(1, 0)$ and $(x, 0)$) while $\Z$ has
               exactly 1 element of finite order.
         \item Suppose to the contrary that $\Z \times \Z$ is cyclic. Then there
               exist nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ such that
               $$\Z \times \Z = \cyc{(a,b)} = \{(na, nb) : n \in \Z\}.$$
               Thus there exists an integer $m$ such that
               $(ma, mb) = (0, 1)$. That is, $ma = 0$ and $mb = 1$. Since
               $ma = 0$, we must have $m = 0$ or $a = 0$. If $m$ is 0, then
               $(ma, mb) = (0, 0) \neq (0, 1)$, a contradiction; thus we must
               have $a = 0$, contradicting our assumption that $a$ is nonzero.
               Thus $\Z \times \Z$ is not cyclic.

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item By Exercise 1.6.11, we know that $\Z \times Z_2$ is isomorphic to
               $Z_2 \times \Z$. By Exercise 2.3.12, $Z_2 \times \Z$ is not
               cyclic; thus $\Z \times Z_2$ is not cyclic. That is,
               $\Z \times Z_2$ is not isomorphic to $\Z$.
         \item Let $Z_2 = \cyc{x}$. It immediately follows that
               $\Q \times Z_2$ and $\Q$ are not isomorphic since $\Q \times Z_2$
               has two elements of finite order(namely $(0, 1)$ and $(0, x)$)

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $l = \text{lcm}(m, n)$. So there exist integers
      $m'$ and $n'$ such that $mm' = nn' = l$. So we have that
      $$(xy)^l = x^ly^l = x^{nn'}y^{mm'} = (x^n)^{n'}(y^m)^{m'} = 1.$$
      That is $|xy|$ divides $l$ (by Proposition 3, Page 55).

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $n \in \Z^+$, $Z_n = \cyc{x}$, $H$ a group, and
      $h^n  = 1$ for some $h \in H$. First we shall show the existence of a
      homomorphism from $Z_n$ to $H$ such that $x \mapsto h$. So consider the

      Clearly $\alpha(x) = h$. Now we will show that $\alpha$ is well defined.
      Suppose $x^w = x^y$ for some $x^w, x^y \in Z_n$. Thus $w = y + nk$ for

      $$\alpha(x^w) = \alpha(x^{y+nk})=h^{y+nk}=h^{y}{h^n}^k =h^y=\alpha(x^y),$$

      $$\alpha(x^px^q)=\alpha(x^{p+q})=h^{p+q}=h^ph^q=\alpha(x^p)\alpha(x^q),$$
      so that $\alpha$ is an homomorphism. Now to show uniqueness, we suppose
      that $\phi : \cyc{x} \rightarrow H$ is an homommorphism such that
      $\phi(x) = h$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, it follows that
      $\phi(x^a) = h^a$. Thus $\phi = \alpha$. \qed

   \item[2.3.19]  Show that if $H$ is any group and $h$ is an element of $H$,
                  then there is a unique homomorphism from $\Z$ to $H$ such that
                  $1 \mapsto h$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.20%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.20]  Let $p$ be a prime and let $n$ be a positive integer. Show
                  that if $x$ is an element of the group $G$ such that
                  $x^{p^n} = 1$ then $|x| = p^m$ for some $m \le n$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.21%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.21]  Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $n$ be a positive integer. Use
                  the Binomial Theorem to show that
                  $(1+p)^{p^{n-1}} \equiv 1$ (mod $p^n$) but
                  $(1+p)^{p^{n-2}} \not\equiv 1$ (mod $p^n$). Deduce that $1+p$
                  is an element of order $p^{n-1}$ in the multiplicative group
                  $(\Z/p^n\Z)^\times$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.22%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.22]  Let $n$ be an integer $\ge 3$. Use the Binomial Theorem to
                  show that $(1+2^2)^{2^{n-2}} \equiv 1$ (mod $2^n$) but
                  $(1+2^2)^{2^{n-3}} \not\equiv 1$ (mod $2^n$). Deduce that 5 is
                  an element of order $2^{n-2}$ in the multiplicative group
                  $(\Z/2^n\Z)^\times$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.23%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.23]  Show that $(\Z/2^n\Z)^\times$ is not cyclic for any $n \ge 3$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.24%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.24]  Let $G$ be a finite group and let $x \in G$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that if $g \in N_G(\cyc{x})$ then
                           $gxg^{-1} = x^a$ for some $a \in \Z$. 
                     \item Prove conversely that if $gxg^{-1} = x^a$ for some
                           $a \in \Z$ then $g \in N_G(\cyc{x})$. [Show first
                           that $gx^kg^{-1} = (gxg^{-1})^k = x^{ak}$ for any
                           integer $k$, so that $g\cyc{x}g^{-1} \le \cyc{x}$.
                           If $x$ has order $n$, show the elements $gx^ig^{-1}$,
                           $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$ are distinct, so that
                           $|g\cyc{x}g^{-1}| = |\cyc{x}| = n$ and conclude that
                           $g\cyc{x}g^{-1} = \cyc{x}$.]
                  \end{enumerate}
                  Note that this cuts down some of the work in computing
                  normalizers of cyclic subgroups since one does not have to
                  check $ghg^{-1} \in \cyc{x}$ for every $h \in \cyc{x}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.25%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.25]  Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ and let $k$ be an
                  integer relatively prime to $n$. Prove that the map
                  $x \mapsto x^k$ is surjective. Use Lagrange's Theorem
                  (Exercise 1.7.19) to prove the same is true for any finite
                  group of order $n$. (For such $k$ each element has a
                  $k^{\text{th}}$ root in $G$. It follows from Cauchy's Theorem
                  in Section 3.2 that if $k$ is not relatively prime to the
                  order of $G$ then the map $x \mapsto x^k$ is not surjective.)

                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $\sigma_a$ is an automorphism of $Z_n$ if
                           and only if $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime(
                           automorphisms were introduced in Exercise 1.6.20).
                     \item Prove that $\sigma_a = \sigma_b$ if and only if
                           $a \equiv b$ (mod $n$).
                     \item Prove that \textit{every} automorphism of $Z_n$ is
                           equal to $\sigma_a$ for some integer $a$.
                     \item Prove that $\sigma_a\circ\sigma_b=\sigma_{ab}$.
                           Deduce that the map $\overline{a} \mapsto \sigma_a$
                           is an isomorphism of $(\Z/n\Z)^\times$ onto the
                           automorphism group of $Z_n$ (so Aut($Z_n$) is an
                           abelian group of order $\varphi(n)$).
