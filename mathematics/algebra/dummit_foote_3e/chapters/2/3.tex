      \textbf{Solution.} Since the positive divisors of 45 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15,
      and 45, it follows that the subgroups of $Z_{45}$ are

                  that this result need not be true if $G$ is an infinite group.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $G$ be a finite group, so that $|G| = n \in \Z^+$.
      Suppose that there exists $x \in G$ such that $|x| = n$. Clearly
      $\cyc{x} \subseteq G$. But $|\cyc{x}| = n$ since $|x| = n$; thus
      $G \subseteq \cyc{x}$ so that $G = \cyc{x}$. Now let $G = \Z$. We have

                  extend to an \textit{isomorphism} from $\Z/48\Z$ onto
                  $Z_{48}$.
                  
      \textbf{Solution.} Suppose that $(a, 48) = 1$. Then it follows that $x^a$
      generates $Z_{48}$. Thus $\varphi_a$ is an isomorphism by Theorem 4 (Page
      56). Now suppose that $a$ is not relatively prime to 48. Then $x^a$ does
      not generate $Z_{48}$, so that the image of $\varphi_a$ is not $Z_{48}$.
      Hence $\varphi_a$ is an isomorphism if and only if $(a, 48) = 1$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.9]   Let $Z_{36} = \cyc{x}$. For which integers $a$ does the map
                  $\psi_a$ defined by $\psi_a : \overline{1} \mapsto x^a$ extend
                  to a \textit{well defined homomorphism} from $\Z/48\Z$ into
                  $Z_{36}$. Can $\psi_a$ ever be a surjective homomorphism?
                  
      \textbf{Solution.} First we shall find the restriction(s) on $a$ such that
      $\psi_a$ is well defined. Suppose $b = c$ for some $b, c \in \Z/48\Z$. It
      suffices to show that $\psi_a(b) = \psi_a(c)$. Since $b = c$, there exists
      an integer $k$ such that $b = c + 48k$. Thus $\psi_a(b) = \psi_a(c+48k)$,
      so that
      $\psi_a(b)=(x^a)^{c+48k}=x^{ac + 48ak}= x^{ac}x^{48ak}=\psi_a(c)x^{12ak}$.
      So we must require $x^{12ak} = 1$ for all $k \in \Z$. Now $x^{12ak} = 1$
      for all $k \in \Z$ if and only if $3 \mid a$ if and only if $\psi_a$ is
      well defined. It follows immediately that
      $\psi_a$ is an homomorphism since
      \begin{align*}
         \psi_a(p + q) &= (x^a)^{p+q} \\
            &= x^{ap+aq} \\
            &= x^{ap}x^{aq} \\
            &= (x^a)^p(x^a)^q \\
            &= \psi_a(p)\psi_a(q)
      \end{align*}      
      for all $p, q \in \Z/48\Z$.
      
      \textit{Can $\psi_a$ ever be a surjective homomorphism?} No!
      
      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose to the contrary that $\psi_a$ is surjective. Then
      there exists $y \in \Z/48\Z$ such that $\psi_a(y) = x$. That is
      $x^{ay} = x$, so that $x^{ay-1} = 1$; thus $ay - 1 = 36m$ for some integer
      $m$. Rearrange the equality $ay - 1 = 36m$ to get $1 = ay - 36m$. Recall
      that $3 \mid a$; since $3$ also divides 36, it follows that 3 must divide
      1, a contradiction. Thus $\psi_a$ can never be surjective. \qed

      The elements of $\cyc{30}$ and their respective orders are:

      \textbf{Solution.} In $D_8$, only $r$ and $r^4$ have order 4. Thus
      $\{1, r, r^2, r^3\}$ is the only cyclic subgroup of order 4. The trivial
      subgroup is the only cyclic subgroup of order 1. Finally there are 5
      cyclic subgroups of order 2 and they are of the form $\{1, x\}$ where

                     \item $Z_2 \times Z_2$
                     \item $Z_2 \times \Z$
                     \item $\Z \times \Z$.
                  \end{enumerate}
      
      \textbf{Proof.}
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item The order of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ is 4, but no element in this group
               has order 4; thus $Z_2 \times Z_2$ is not cyclic.
         \item Let $Z_2 = \cyc{x}$. Observe that $Z_2 \times \Z$ is not finite,
               so in order for it to be cyclic it must be isomorphic to $\Z$.
               But this is not the case since $Z_2 \times \Z$ has two elements
               of finite order(namely $(1, 0)$ and $(x, 0)$) while $\Z$ has
               exactly 1 element of finite order.
         \item Suppose to the contrary that $\Z \times \Z$ is cyclic. Then there
               exist nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ such that
               $$\Z \times \Z = \cyc{(a,b)} = \{(na, nb) : n \in \Z\}.$$
               Thus there exists an integer $m$ such that
               $(ma, mb) = (0, 1)$. That is, $ma = 0$ and $mb = 1$. Since
               $ma = 0$, we must have $m = 0$ or $a = 0$. If $m$ is 0, then
               $(ma, mb) = (0, 0) \neq (0, 1)$, a contradiction; thus we must
               have $a = 0$, contradicting our assumption that $a$ is nonzero.
               Thus $\Z \times \Z$ is not cyclic.

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item By Exercise 1.6.11, we know that $\Z \times Z_2$ is isomorphic to
               $Z_2 \times \Z$. By Exercise 2.3.12, $Z_2 \times \Z$ is not
               cyclic; thus $\Z \times Z_2$ is not cyclic. That is,
               $\Z \times Z_2$ is not isomorphic to $\Z$.
         \item Let $Z_2 = \cyc{x}$. It immediately follows that
               $\Q \times Z_2$ and $\Q$ are not isomorphic since $\Q \times Z_2$
               has two elements of finite order(namely $(0, 1)$ and $(0, x)$)

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $l = \text{lcm}(m, n)$. So there exist integers
      $m'$ and $n'$ such that $mm' = nn' = l$. So we have that
      $$(xy)^l = x^ly^l = x^{nn'}y^{mm'} = (x^n)^{n'}(y^m)^{m'} = 1.$$
      That is $|xy|$ divides $l$ (by Proposition 3, Page 55).

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $n \in \Z^+$, $Z_n = \cyc{x}$, $H$ a group, and
      $h^n  = 1$ for some $h \in H$. First we shall show the existence of a

      Clearly $\alpha(x) = h$. Now we will show that $\alpha$ is well defined.
      Suppose $x^w = x^y$ for some $x^w, x^y \in Z_n$. Thus $w = y + nk$ for

      $$\alpha(x^w) = \alpha(x^{y+nk})=h^{y+nk}=h^{y}{h^n}^k =h^y=\alpha(x^y),$$

      $$\alpha(x^px^q)=\alpha(x^{p+q})=h^{p+q}=h^ph^q=\alpha(x^p)\alpha(x^q),$$
      so that $\alpha$ is an homomorphism. Now to show uniqueness, we suppose
      that $\phi : \cyc{x} \rightarrow H$ is an homommorphism such that
      $\phi(x) = h$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, it follows that
      $\phi(x^a) = h^a$. Thus $\phi = \alpha$, as desired. \qed

   \item[2.3.19]  Show that if $H$ is any group and $h$ is an element of $H$,
                  then there is a unique homomorphism from $\Z$ to $H$ such that
                  $1 \mapsto h$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $H$ be a group and let $h \in H$. First we shall show
      that there exists a homomorphism from $\Z$ to $H$ such that $1 \mapsto h$.
      So consider the map $\alpha : \Z \rightarrow H$ defined by
      $n \mapsto h^n$. Clearly $\alpha(1) = h$ and
      $$\alpha(x+y) = h^{x+y} = h^xh^y = \alpha(x)\alpha(y) \text{ for all }
        x, y \in \Z^+,$$
      so that $\alpha$ is a homomorphism. To show uniqueness, suppose that
      $\alpha' : \Z \rightarrow H$ is an homomorphism such that
      $\alpha'(1) = h$. Then according to Exercise 1.6.1, we have that
      $\alpha'(n) = \alpha'(n\cdot1) = \alpha'(1)^n = h^n$ for all $n \in \Z$;
      that is, $\alpha' = \alpha$, as desired. \qed

   \item[2.3.20]  Let $p$ be a prime and let $n$ be a positive integer. Show
                  that if $x$ is an element of the group $G$ such that
                  $x^{p^n} = 1$ then $|x| = p^m$ for some $m \le n$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $x \in G$ such that $x^{p^n} = 1$. Then it
      follows by Proposition 3 (Page 55) that $|x|$ divides $p^n$. Since $p$ is
      a prime, its factors are $p^i$, $0 \le i \le n$. Thus $|x| = p^m$ for
      some nonnegative $m$ not greater than $n$. \qed

   \item[2.3.21]  Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $n$ be a positive integer
                  $\ge 2$. Use the Binomial Theorem to show that
                  $(1+p)^{p^{n-1}} \equiv 1$ (mod $p^n$) but
                  $(1+p)^{p^{n-2}} \not\equiv 1$ (mod $p^n$). Deduce that $1+p$
                  is an element of order $p^{n-1}$ in the multiplicative group
                  $(\Z/p^n\Z)^\times$.

      \textbf{Lemma 2.3.1.} \textit{For an integer $n \ge 2$ and an odd prime
      $p$, let $f_p(n)$ be the number of $p$ factors of $n!$ (i.e., the greatest
      nonnegative integer $j$ such that $p^j \mid i!$), then it follows that
      $f_p(n) < \D\frac{n}{2}$}.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $n \ge 2$ be an integer and $p$ an odd prime. For a
      a positive integer $r$, let $g_p(n, r)$ be the number of positive
      integers, less than or equal to $n$, that have at least $r$ number of $p$ 
      factors. It follows that $g_p(n, r) = \D\gint{\frac{n}{p^r}}$, where
      $\gint{x}$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. Finally let
      $k_n$ be the maximum nonnegative integer such that $p^{k_n}$ is a multiple
      of some positive integer not greater than $n$. Thus we have that
      \begin{align*}
         f_p(n) &= g_p(n, 1) + g_p(n, 2) + \cdots + g_p(n, k_n) \\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^{k_n} g_p(n, i)
            = \sum_{i=1}^{k_n} \gint{\frac{n}{p^i}} \\
            &\le \sum_{i=1}^{k_n} \frac{n}{p^i}
            < \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{n}{p^i} \\
            &= \frac{n}{p-1} &[\text{Sum of Geometric Series}] \\
            &< \frac{n}{2}. &[\text{Since }p \ge 3]
      \end{align*}

      So we can write $n! = p^{f_p(n)} h_n$ for some $h_n \in \Z^+$, so that
      $(h_n, p) = 1$.

      Now we are ready to commence the proof of the problem. By the Binomial
      Theorem, we have that
      \begin{align*}
         (1+p)^{p^{n-1}} &= \sum_{i=0}^{p^{n-1}}\binom{p^{n-1}}{i}p^i \\
            &= \sum_{i=0}^{p^{n-1}}p^i\frac{p^{n-1}(p^{n-1}-1)(p^{n-1}-2)
               \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{i!} \\
            &= \sum_{i=0}^{p^{n-1}}p^i\frac{p^{n-1}(p^{n-1}-1)(p^{n-1}-2)
               \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{p^{f_p(i)} h_i} \\
            &= 1 + p^n + p^n\sum_{i=2}^{p^{n-1}}\frac{p^{i-1}(p^{n-1}-1)
               (p^{n-1}-2) \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{p^{f_p(i)} h_i}.
      \end{align*}
      Now $f_p(i) < i / 2 \le i - 1$ for $i \ge 2$. Thus $i - 1 - f_p(i) \ge 0$
      (so that $p^{i - 1 - f_p(i)}$ is an integer) if $i \ge 2$. We then have
      \begin{equation} \label{2_3_21_1}
         (1+p)^{p^{n-1}} = 1 + p^n + p^n\sum_{i=2}^{p^{n-1}}\frac{p^{i-1-f_p(i)}
        (p^{n-1}-1)(p^{n-1}-2) \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{h_i}
      \end{equation}
      Since $(h_i, p) = 1$, it follows that $h_i$ must divide
      $p^{i-1}(p^{n-1}-1)(p^{n-1}-2) \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)$. Hence
      $$\sum_{i=2}^{p^{n-1}}\frac{p^{i-1-f_p(i)}
        (p^{n-1}-1)(p^{n-1}-2) \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{h_i}$$
      is an integer and we can conclude from \eqref{2_3_21_1} that
      $(1+p)^{p^{n-1}} \equiv 1$ (mod $p^n$). Now we have that
      \begin{align*}
         (1+p)^{p^{n-2}} &= \sum_{i=0}^{p^{n-2}}\binom{p^{n-2}}{i}p^i \\
            &= \sum_{i=0}^{p^{n-2}}p^i\frac{p^{n-2}(p^{n-2}-1)(p^{n-2}-2)
               \cdots(p^{n-2}-i+1)}{i!} \\
            &= 1 + p^{n-1} + p^n\frac{p^{n-2}-1}{2} + p^n\frac{p(p^{n-2}-1)(p^{n-2}-2)}{3!} +\sum_{i=4}^{p^{n-1}}p^i\frac{p^{n-2}(p^{n-2}-1)(p^{n-2}-2)
               \cdots(p^{n-2}-i+1)}{p^{f_p(i)} h_i} \\
            &= 1 + p^n + p^n\sum_{i=2}^{p^{n-1}}\frac{p^{i-1}(p^{n-1}-1)
               (p^{n-1}-2) \cdots(p^{n-1}-i+1)}{p^{f_p(i)} h_i}.
