   \item[2.4.1]   Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $\cyc{H} = H$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $H$ is a subgroup of some group $G$. Let
      $h \in H$. By definition of $\cyc{H}$, we have that $h^1 \in \cyc{H}$, so
      that $H \subseteq \cyc{H}$. Now let $h' \in \cyc{H}$. Then it follows that
      $h' = h_1^{a_1}h_2^{a_2}\cdots h_n^{a_n}$, where $h^i \in H$ and $a_i$
      is an integer for all $1 \le i \le n$. Since $H$ is closed under
      multiplication, it follows that
      $h' = h_1^{a_1}h_2^{a_2}\cdots h_n^{a_n} \in H$. That is, 
      $\cyc{H} \subseteq H$, and we can conclude that $\cyc{H} = H$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.2]   Prove that if $A$ is a subset of $B$ then
                  $\cyc{A} \le \cyc{B}$. Give an example where $A \subseteq B$
                  with $A \neq B$ but $\cyc{A} = \cyc{B}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $A$ is a subset of some set $B$. If
      $A = \emptyset$, then $\cyc{A} = \{1\} \le \cyc{B}$. So suppose that
      $A \neq \emptyset$. Let $a \in \cyc{A}$. Then it follows by definition
      that $a = {a_1}^{\varepsilon_1}{a_2}^{\varepsilon_2}\cdots
      {a_n}^{\varepsilon_n}$ for some $a_i \in A$ and integers $\varepsilon_i$
      for all $1 \le i \le n$. But since $a_i \in A$ and $A \subseteq B$, it
      follows that $a_i \in B$; thus $a \in B$, and we conclude that
      $\cyc{A} \subseteq \cyc{B}$, so that $\cyc{A} \le \cyc{B}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.3]   Prove that if $H$ is an abelian subgroup of a group $G$ then
                  $\cyc{H, Z(G)}$ is abelian. Give an explicit example of an
                  abelian subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ such that
                  $\cyc{H, C_G(H)}$ is not abelian.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $H$ is an abelian subgroup of some group $G$. Let
      $h \in H$. It follows that $h$ commutes with all elements of $H$ since
      $H$ is abelian; also $h$ commutes with all elements of $Z(G)$. Similarly,
      every element in $Z(G)$ commutes with one another and with the elements of
      $H$. Thus the set $H \cup Z(G)$ is abelian, so that $\cyc{H, Z(G)}$ is
      abelian.

      \textbf{Example.} We have $\cyc{\{1\}, C_{D_6}(\{1\})} =
      \cyc{\{1\}, D_6}= D_6$, a nonabelian group.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.4]   Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $H$ is generated
                  by the set $H - \{1\}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $H$ be a subgroup of some group $G$. If $H = \{1\}$,
      then $\cyc{H - \{1\}} = \cyc{\emptyset} = \{1\} = H$. So suppose that
      $H$ has more than 1 element. Let $h$ be a nonidentity element in $H$.
      Since $h \neq 1$, it follows that $h^{-1} \neq 1$, so that
      $h^{-1} \in H - \{1\}$. By definition, we must
      have $1 = h^1(h^{-1})^1 \in  \cyc{H - \{1\}}$. Since
      $H - \{1\} \subseteq \cyc{H - \{1\}}$ and $1 \in \cyc{H - \{1\}}$, it 
      follows that $H = [(H - \{1\}) \cup \{1\}] \subseteq \cyc{H - \{1\}}$. We
      know that $\cyc{H - \{1\}} \subseteq H$; thus $H = \cyc{H - \{1\}}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.5]   Prove that the subgroup generated by any two distinct elements
                  of order 2 in $S_3$ is all of $S_3$.

      \textbf{Proof.} We know from the discussion on Page 43 of the textbook
      that $D_6 \cong S_3$, so it suffices to show that any two distinct
      elements of order 2 in $D_6$ is all of $D_6$. The elements of order 2 in
      $D_6$ are: $s$, $sr$, and $sr^2$. Since $\cyc{r, s} = D_6$, it suffices to
      show that $r$ and $s$ are both elements of $\cyc{s, sr}$, $\cyc{s, sr^2}$,
      and $\cyc{sr, sr^2}$. Now we have $s(sr) = r$, so that
      $r, s \in \cyc{s, sr}$. Also $(s)(sr^2)(s)(sr^2) = r$, so that
      $r, s \in \cyc{s, sr^2}$. Finally we have $(sr)(sr^2) = r$ and
      $(sr)(sr^2)(sr) = s$, so that $r, s \in \cyc{sr, sr^2}$. We can thus
      conclude that
      $$\cyc{s, sr} = \cyc{s, sr^2} = \cyc{sr, sr^2} = D_6,$$
      as desired. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.6]   Prove that the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by (1 2) and
                  (1 2)(3 4) is a noncyclic group of order 4.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $x = (1\;2)$ and $y = (1\;2)(3\;4)$. It is easy to see
      that $xy = yx^{-1}$. Thus every element of $\cyc{x, y}$ can be written in
      the form $x^iy^j$ for some integers $i$ and $j$. Since $|x| = |y| = 2$, it
      follows that $|\cyc{x, y}| \le 4$. But $x^2 = 1$ and $xy = (3\;4)$, so
      that $|\cyc{x, y}| = 4$. Notice that no element of $|\cyc{x, y}|$ has
      order 4. Thus $\cyc{x, y}$ is not cyclic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.7]   Prove that the subgroup of $S_4$ generated by (1 2) and
                  (1 3)(2 4) is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $y = (1\;2)$ and $z = (1\;3)(2\;4)$ be elements in
      $S_4$. Also let $x = yz = (1\;3\;2\;4)$. Since $yx = z$, it follows that
      $\cyc{z, y} = \cyc{x, y}$. Observe that $x$ and $y$ satisfy the same
      relations as $r$ and $s$ in $D_8$; that is, $x^4 = y^2 = 1$ and
      $xy = yx^{-1}$. The last relation tells us that every element in
      $\cyc{x, y}$ can be written in the form $y^ix^j$ for some integers
      $0 \le i < 4$ and $0 \le j < 2$. Computing these elements we shall get 
      that $|\cyc{x, y}| = 8$. By the discussion on Page 38, it follows that
      there exists a unique isomorphism that maps $r$ to $x$ and $s$ to $y$;
      thus $D_8 \cong \cyc{x, y}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.8]   Prove that $S_4 = \cyc{(1\;2\;3\;4), (1\;2\;4\;3)}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $x = (1\;2\;3\;4)$ and $y = (1\;2\;4\;3)$ be members
      of $S_4$. By computation, we see that the following elements 
      $$1, x, x^2, x^3, y, y^2, y^3, xy, xyxy, yx, yxyx, xyxy^2,
        \text{ and } xyxy^2xyxy^2$$
      of $\cyc{x, y}$ are distinct. Thus $|\cyc{x, y}| \ge 13$. By Lagrange's
      Theorem, $|\cyc{x, y}|$ must divide $|S_4| = 24$. The only possibility is
      $|\cyc{x, y}| = 24$, so that $\cyc{x, y} = S_4$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.9]   Prove that $SL_2(\F_3)$ is the subgroup of $GL_2(\F_3)$
                  generated by $\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
                     1 & 1 \\

                     1 & 1
                  \end{tabular}\right)$. [Recall from Exercise 2.1.9 that
                  $SL_2(\F_3)$ is the subgroup of matrices of determinant 1. You
                  may assume this subgroup has order 24---this will be an
                  exercise in Section 3.2.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.10]  Prove that the subgroup of $SL_2(\F_3)$ generated by

                  \end{tabular}\right)$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group of

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.4.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.4.17]  This is an exercise involving Zorn's Lemma (see Appendix I) to
                  prove that every nontrivial finitely generated group possesses
                  maximal subgroups. Let $G$ be a finitely generated group, say
                  $G = \cyc{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n}$, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be
                  the set of all proper subgroups of $G$. Then $\mathcal{S}$ is

                           definition of a chain to arrive at a contradiction.]
