Let $G$ and $H$ be groups.

\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.1]   Let $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism and let $E$
                  be a subgroup of $H$. Prove that $\varphi^{-1}(E) \le G$
                  (i.e., the preimage or pullback of a subgroup under a
                  homomorphism is a subgroup). If $E \trianglelefteq H$ prove
                  that $\varphi^{-1}(E) \trianglelefteq G$. Deduce that
                  $\text{ker}\varphi \trianglelefteq G$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $\varphi(1) = 1 \in E$ (Proposition 1), it follows 
      that $1 \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$, and hence, $\varphi^{-1}(E)$ is not empty. 
      Now let $x, y \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$. That is, $\varphi(x),\varphi(y)\in E$. 
      Since $E$ is a group, it follows that $\varphi(x)\varphi(y)^{-1} \in E$. 
      Thus by the homomorphic property of $\varphi$ and Proposition 1, it
      follows that $\varphi(xy^{-1}) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y^{-1}) = \varphi(x)
      \varphi(y)^{-1} \in E$, so that $xy^{-1} \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$. Hence
      $\varphi^{-1}(E) \le G$ by the Subgroup Criterion. Now suppose that $E$ is 
      a normal subgroup of $H$. Let $g \in G$ and $z \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$. To 
      show that $\varphi^{-1}(E)$ is 
      normal in $G$, it suffices to show that $gzg^{-1} \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$; 
      that is, we must show that the image of $gzg^{-1}$ under $\varphi$ lies in 
      $E$. By Proposition 1, we know that $\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}$. 
      Thus
      $$\varphi(gzg^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(z)\varphi(g^{-1}) =
        \varphi(g)\varphi(z)\varphi(g)^{-1}.$$
      The elements $\varphi(g)$ and $\varphi(g)^{-1}$ are clearly in $H$. Also
      $\varphi(z) \in E$ because $z \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$. Now since $E$ is
      normal in $H$, it follows by Theorem 6 that
      $\varphi(gzg^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(z)\varphi(g)^{-1} \in E$, so that
      $gzg^{-1} \in \varphi^{-1}(E)$; conclude that
      $\varphi^{-1}(E) \trianglelefteq G$. If $E$ is the trivial subgroup, then
      $1 \trianglelefteq H$, so that
      $\varphi^{-1}(1) = \text{ker}\varphi \trianglelefteq G$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.2]   Let $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism of groups
                  with kernel $K$ and let $a, b \in \varphi(G)$. Let
                  $X \in G/K$ be the fiber above $a$ and let $Y$ be the fiber
                  above $b$, i.e., $X = \varphi^{-1}(a)$, $Y = \varphi^{-1}(b)$.
                  Fix an element $u$ of $X$ (so $\varphi(u) = a$). Prove that if
                  $XY = Z$ in the quotient group $G/K$ and $w$ is any member of
                  $Z$, then there is some $v \in Y$ such that $uv = w$. [Show
                  that $u^{-1}w \in Y$.]

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $Z = XY$ (i.e., $Z$ is the fiber over $ab$) and fix
      $w \in Z$. We have that
      \begin{align*}
         \varphi(u^{-1}w) &= \varphi(u^{-1})\varphi(w) \\
            &= \varphi(u)^{-1}\varphi(w) &[\text{Proposition 1}] \\
            &= a^{-1}(ab) = (a^{-1}a)b = b,
      \end{align*}
      so that $u^{-1}w \in Y$. Since $u(u^{-1}w) = w$, we let $v = u^{-1}w$.\qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.3]   Let $A$ be an abelian group and let $B$ be a subgroup of $A$.
                  Prove that $A/B$ is abelian. Give an example of a non-abelian
                  group $G$ containing a proper normal subgroup $N$ such that
                  $G/N$ is abelian.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $X, Y \in A/B$. Then $X = aB$ and $Y = dB$ for some
      $a, d \in A$. It follows immediately that $A/B$ is abelian because
      \begin{align*}
         XY &= (aB)(dB) \\
            &= (ad)B = (da)B &[A\text{ is abelian}] \\
            &= (dB)(aB) \\
            &= YX,
      \end{align*}
      so that $A/B$ is abelian.

      \textbf{Example.} Let $G = D_8$ and $N = \cyc{r}$. By Example 2.2.3, $N$
      is normal in $D_8$. By computation, we get $G/N = \{sN, N\}$, so that
      $G/N \cong Z_2$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.4]   Prove that in the quotient group $G/N$,
                  $(gN)^\alpha = g^\alpha N$ for all $\alpha \in \Z$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Proceed by induction on $\alpha$. The statement is clearly
      true for $\alpha = 1$, so suppose $(gN)^k = g^kN$ for some positive
      integer $k$. So
      \begin{align*}
         (gN)^{k+1} &= (gN)^kgN &[\text{Exercise 1.1.19}] \\
            &= g^kNgN &[\text{Inductive Hypothesis}] \\
            &= (g^kg)N \\
            &= g^{k+1}N. &[\text{Exercise 1.1.19}]
      \end{align*}
      Thus our statement holds for all positive integer $\alpha$. For a postive
      integer $n$, we have that
      \begin{align*}
         (gN)^{-n} &= ((gN)^{-1})^n &[\text{Definition}] \\
            &= (g^{-1}N)^n &[\text{Proposition 5}] \\
            &= (g^{-1})^nN &[\text{From Inductive Proof Above}] \\
            &= g^{-n}N. &[\text{Definition}] 
      \end{align*}
      Finally $(gN)^0 = 1 = N = 1N = g^0N$, so that our statement holds for each
      integer $\alpha$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.5]   Use the preceding exercise to prove that the order of the
                  element $gN$ in $G/N$ is $n$, where $n$ is the smallest
                  positive integer such that $g^n \in N$ (and $gN$ has infinite
                  order if no such positive integer exists). Give an example to
                  show that the order of $gN$ in $G/N$ may be strictly smaller
                  than the order of $g$ in $G$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose first that $|gN| = n \in \Z^+$. That is, $n$ is\
      the smallest positive integer such that $(gN)^n = g^nN = N$, where the
      last equality follows from Exercise 4. By Proposition 4, it follows that
      $g^n \in N$.

      \textbf{Example.} Let $G = D_8$ and $N = \cyc{r}$. By Example 2.2.3, $N$
      is normal in $D_8$. Since $G/N = \{N, sN\}$, we have $|rN| = 1 < 4 = |r|$. 
      \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.6]   Define $\varphi : \R^\times \rightarrow \{\pm1\}$ by letting
                  $\varphi(x)$ be $x$ divided by the absolute value of $x$.
                  Describe the fibers of $\varphi$ and prove that $\varphi$ is a
                  homomorphism.
   
      \textbf{Proof.} By inspection, we see that $\varphi$ maps the positive
      reals to 1 and the negative reals to $-1$. Thus the fibers of $\varphi$
      are the set of positive real numbers and the set of negative real numbers.
      The map $\varphi$ is a homomorphism because
      $$\varphi(ab) = \frac{ab}{|ab|} = \frac{ab}{|a||b|} = \frac{a}{|a|}
        \frac{b}{|b|} = \varphi(a)\varphi(b),$$
      for every nonzero real numbers $a$ and $b$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.7]   Define $\pi : \R^2 \rightarrow \R$ by $\pi((x, y)) = x + y$.
                  Prove that $\pi$ is a surjective homomorphism and describe the
                  kernel and fibers of $\pi$ geometrically.

      \textbf{Proof.} The map $\pi$ is surjective because if $r \in \R$, then
      $(r, 0) \in \R^2$, so that $\pi(r, 0) = r + 0 = r$; it is also an
      homomorphism because, for $(a, b), (c, d) \in \R^2$, we have that
      $$\pi((a, b) + (c, d)) = \pi(a + c, b + d) = a + c + b + d =
        a + b + c + d =\pi(a, b) + \pi(c, d).$$
      The kernel of $\pi$ is the $y$-axis and the fibers are lines parallel to
      the $y$-axis. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.8]   Let $\varphi : \R^\times \rightarrow \R^\times$ be the map
                  sending $x$ to the absolute value of $x$. Prove that $\varphi$
                  is a homomorphism and find the image of $\varphi$. Describe
                  the kernel and the fibers of $\varphi$.

      \textbf{Proof.} For $a, b \in \R^\times$, we have that
      $$\varphi(ab) = |ab| = |a| \cdot |b| = \varphi(a)\varphi(b),$$
      so that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. The image of $\varphi$ is the set of
      all positive real numbers. The kernel of $\varphi$ is $\{\pm 1\}$ and the
      fibers of $\varphi$ are all sets of the form
      $\{\pm a : a \in \R^+\}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.9]   Define $\varphi : \C^\times \rightarrow \R^\times$ by
                  $\varphi(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2$. Prove that $\varphi$ is a
                  homomorphism and find the image of $\varphi$. Describe the
                  kernel and the fibers of $\varphi$ geometrically (as subsets
                  of the plane).

      \textbf{Proof.}  Let $z$ and $w$ be nonzero complex numbers. Then we have
      $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di$, for some real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and
      $d$. So
      \begin{align*}
         \varphi(zw) &= \varphi((a + bi)(c + di)) \\
            &= \varphi(ac - bd + (ad + bc)i) \\
            &= (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2 \\
            &= (ac)^2 + (bd)^2 - 2abcd + (ad)^2 + (bc)^2 + 2abcd \\
            &= (ac)^2 + (bd)^2 + (ad)^2 + (bc)^2 \\
            &= a^2(c^2 + d^2) + b^2(c^2 + d^2) \\
            &= (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \\
            &= \varphi(a + bi)\varphi(c + di) \\
            &= \varphi(z)\varphi(w).
      \end{align*}
      Thus $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. The kernel of $\varphi$ is the unit
      circle centered at the origin. The fibers of $\varphi$ are the circles of
      (nonzero radius) centered at the origin. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.10]  Let $\varphi : \Z/8\Z \rightarrow \Z/4\Z$ by
                  $\varphi(\m{a}) = \m{a}$. Show that this is a well defined, 
                  surjective homomorphism and describe its fibers and kernel 
                  explicitly (showing that $\varphi$ is well defined involves
                  the fact that $\m{a}$ has a different meaning in the domain
                  and range of $\varphi$).

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $\m{a} = \m{b}$ in $\Z/8\Z$, it follows that
      $a = b + 8k$ for some integer $k$. We thus have that
      \begin{align*}
         \varphi(\m{a}) &= \varphi(a + 8\Z) \\
            &= a + 4\Z \\
            &= b + 4\Z &[a - b = 4(2k) \in 4\Z] \\
            &= \varphi(b + 8\Z) = \varphi(\m{b});
      \end{align*}
      i.e., $\varphi$ is well defined. The map $\varphi$ is an homomorphism
      because
      $$\varphi(\m{a} + \m{b}) = \varphi(\m{a + b}) = \m{a + b} =
        \m{a} + \m{b}.$$
      Surjectivity of $\varphi$ is immediate because if $a + 4\Z \in \Z/4\Z$,
      then $\varphi(a + 8\Z) = a + 4\Z$. Now $\varphi(a + 8\Z) = 4\Z$ if and
      only if $a +4\Z = 4\Z$ if and only if $a$ is a multiple of $4$. Thus
      kernel of $\varphi = \{\m{0}, \m{4}\}$, and the fibers of $\varphi$ are
      $\{\{\m{0}, \m{4}\}, \{\m{1}, \m{5}\}, \{\m{2}, \m{6}\},
       \{\m{3}, \m{7}\}\}$. \qed
