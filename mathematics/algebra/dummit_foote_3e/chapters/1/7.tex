%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.1]   Let $F$ be a field. Show that the multiplicative group of
                  nonzero elements of $F$ (denoted by $F^\times$) acts on the
                  set $F$ by $g \cdot a = ga$, where $g \in F^\times$,
                  $a \in F$ and $ga$ is the usual product in $F$ of the two
                  field elements (state clearly which axioms in the definition
                  of a field are used).

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $f_1, f_2 \in F^\times$ and $f_3 \in F$. It is clear
      that $f_1f_3 \in F$ because $F$ is closed under multiplication. Since 1 is
      is the identity for $(F^\times, \cdot)$, we have that $1 \cdot f_3 = f_3$.
      By the associativity of multiplication in $F$, it follows that
      $f_1(f_2f_3) = (f_1f_2)f_3$. Thus $F^\times$ acts on $F$ by
      multiplication. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.2]   Show that the additive group $\Z$ acts on itself by
                  $z \cdot a = z + a$ for all $z, a \in \Z$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ be integers. Clearly
      $z_1 \cdot z_3 = z_1 + z_3 \in \Z$. Notice that the identity of $(\Z, +)$ 
      is 0; thus $z_1 \cdot 0 = z_1 + 0 = z_1$. Using the associativity of $\Z$ 
      under +, we have that
      $$z_1 \cdot (z_2 \cdot z_3) = z_1 + (z_2 + z_3) = (z_1 + z_2) + z_3 =
      (z_1 \cdot z_2) \cdot z_3.$$
      Thus $\Z$ acts on itself by the given operation. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.3]   Show that the additive group $\R$ acts on the $x, y$ plane
                  $\R \times \R$ by $r \cdot (x, y) = (x + ry, y)$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$, and $r_4$ be real numbers. Since
      $\R$ is closed under addition, we have that
      $r_1 \cdot (r_2, r_3) = (r_2 + r_1r_3, r_3) \in \R \times \R$. We also
      have that
      $$0 \cdot (r_1, r_2) = (r_1 + 0 \cdot r_2, r_2) = (r_1, r_2).$$
      Finally we have that
      \begin{align*}
         r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot (r_3, r_4)) &= r_1 \cdot (r_3 + r_2r_4, r_4) \\
            &= (r_3 + r_2r_4 + r_1r_4, r_4) \\
            &= (r_3 + (r_2 + r_1)r_4, r_4) \\
            &= (r_2 + r_1) \cdot (r_3, r_4), \\
      \end{align*}
      so that $\R$ acts on the cartesian plane by the given operation. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.4]   Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $A$ and fix some $a \in A$.
                  Show that the following sets are subgroups of $G$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item the kernel of the action,
                     \item $\{g \in G : ga = a\}$---this subgroup is called the
                           \textit{stablizer} of $a$ in $G$.
                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Proof.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Let $K$ be the kernel of this action. The set $K$ is not empty
               because $1 \in K$. Now let $g, h \in K$ and $a_1 \in A$. So we
               have that
               \begin{align*}
                  (gh^{-1})a_1 &= g(h^{-1}a_1) \\
                     &= g(h^{-1}(ha_1)) &[ha_1 = a_1] \\
                     &= g((h^{-1}h)a_1) \\
                     & = g(1a_1) = ga_1 = a_1.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $gh^{-1} \in K$, so that $K$ is a subgroup of $G$.

         \item Let $G_a$ be the stabilizer of $a$. Argue similarly as in (a),
               replacing $a_1$ with $a$, to conclude that $G_a$ is a subgroup of
               $G$.
      \end{enumerate}  \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.5]   Prove that the kernel of an action of the group $G$ on the set
                  $A$ is the same as the kernel of the corresponding permutation
                  representation $G \rightarrow S_A$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $K_1$ be the kernel of the action of $G$ on $A$ and
      let $K_2$ be the kernel of the permutation representation
      $\varphi : G \rightarrow S_A$. The proof follows since
      \begin{align*}
         g \in K_1 &\Longleftrightarrow ga = a \quad\text{ for all } a \in A \\
            &\Longleftrightarrow \varphi(g)(a)=a\quad\text{ for all } a\in A \\
            &\Longleftrightarrow \varphi(g) = 1 \\
            &\Longleftrightarrow g \in K_2.
      \end{align*} \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.6]   Prove that a group $G$ acts faithfully on a set $A$ if and
                  only if the kernel of the action is the set consisting only of
                  the identity.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $\varphi : G \rightarrow S_A$ be the corresponding 
      permutation representation.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Assume that $G$ acts faithfully on $A$. Let $g$ be an
      element of the kernel of this action. Then it follows that
      $\varphi(g) = 1$; but $\varphi$ is injective (since this action is
      faithul), so that $g = 1$, and it follows that the kernel of the action is
      trivial.

      ($\Leftarrow$) Conversely, suppose the kernel of this action is trivial.
      Then it follows by Exercise 1.7.5 that the kernel of $\varphi$ is also
      trivial. So suppose that $\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_3)$. Then we have
      that $\varphi(g_2{g_3}^{-1}) = 1$, and since the kernel of $\varphi$ is 
      trivial, it follows that $g_2{g_3}^{-1} = 1$. Thus $g_2 = g_3$ and we
      have that $\varphi$ is injective; that is, $G$ acts faithfully on $A$.
      \qed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.7]   Prove that in Example 2 in this section the action is
                  faithful when the vector space is nonzero.

      \textbf{Proof.} Consider a nonzero vector space $V$ over $F$. Let
      $F^\times$ act on $V$ by left multiplication. Suppose to the contrary that
      two unequal members of $F^\times$---say $f_1$ and $f_2$---induce the same 
      permutation on $V$. Let $v$ be a nonzero element in $V$. Then we must 
      particularly have that $f_1v = f_2v$, so that $(f_1 - f_2)v = 0$. Since
      $f_1 \neq f_2$, it follows that $f_1 - f_2 \neq 0$, so that $f_1 - f_2$
      has a multiplicative inverse in $F^\times$. Multiply $(f_1 - f_2)v = 0$
      by this inverse to get $v = 0$, a contradiction. Thus no two members of
      $F^\times$ induce the same permutation, so that the action of $F^\times$
      on $V$ is faithful. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.8]   Let $A$ be a nonempty set and let $k$ be a positive integer
                  with $k \le |A|$. The symmetric group $S_A$ acts on the set
                  $B$ consisting of all subsets of $A$ of cardinality $k$ by
                  $\sigma \cdot \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\} = \{\sigma(a_1), \ldots,

                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}
   
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $\sigma, \alpha \in S_A$ and
               $\{a_1, \ldots, a_k\} \in B$. Since $\sigma$ is injective, it 
               follows that $\sigma(a_1)$, $\ldots$, $\sigma(a_k)$ are all 
               distinct, so that $\{\sigma(a_1), \ldots, \sigma(a_k)\} \in B$.
               Now $1 \cdot\nobreak \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\} = \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}$
               and
               \begin{align*}
                  \sigma \cdot (\alpha \cdot \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}) &=
                     \sigma \cdot \{\alpha(a_1), \ldots, \alpha(a_k)\} \\
                     &= \{\sigma(\alpha(a_1)), \ldots, \sigma(\alpha(a_k))\} \\
                     &= \{(\sigma\circ\alpha)(a_1), \ldots,
                          (\sigma\circ\alpha)(a_k)\} \\
                     &= (\sigma\circ\alpha) \cdot \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}.
               \end{align*}
               
               Thus the operation is a group action. \qed

                           ordered $k$-tuples is faithful.
                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}
   
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \textit{If $k < n$, then this action is faithful}.

               \textbf{Proof.} By Exercise 1.7.6, it suffices to show that
               kernel of this action is trivial (Exercise 1.7.6). Let $\sigma$ 
               be a nonidentity element in $S_n$, so that $\sigma(i) = j$ for 
               some $i \neq j$. Let $B$ be any $k$-subset such that $i \in B$
               and $j \neq B$. Notice that $B \neq \sigma B$ since
               $j \in \sigma B$. Thus $\sigma$ is not in the kernel of this 
               action. Since $\sigma$ was an arbitrary nonidentity element, it 
               follows that the kernel of this action is trivial, so that this 
               action is faithful by Exercise 1.7.6. \qed \\
   
               \textit{If $k = n$, then this action is not faithful}.

               \textbf{Proof.} Observe that the set of all $n$-element subsets 
               contains a single element, $I_n = \{1, \ldots, n\}$. Thus every 
               element of $S_n$ must map $I_n$ to itself, so that every element 
               of $S_n$ induces the same permutation. \qed
         \item \textit{This action is faithful for all $k \le n$}.

               \textbf{Proof.} Let $\sigma$ be a nonidentity element in $S_n$.
               Then $\sigma(i) = j$ for some $i \neq j$. Let $B$ be any
               $k$-tuple with $i$ as its first element. Then the first element
               of $\sigma A$ is $j$; thus $A \neq \sigma A$; that is, the kernel 
               of this action is trivial, so that this action of $S_n$ on
               ordered $k$-tuples is faithful. \qed

   \item[1.7.12]  Assume $n$ is an even positive integer and show that $D_{2n}$
                  acts on the set consisting of pairs of opposite vertices of a
                  regular $n$-gon. Find the kernel of this action (label
                  vertices as usual).

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $n$ is an even integer greater than 3. So
      write $n = 2k$. Label the vertices of a regular $n$-gon as was done on
      Page 24 of the text. Let $I_n = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ be the set of
      vertices of the $n$-gon. Also for the sake of convenience, we shall assume
      that two vertices $x$ and $y$ are equal if and only if $x \equiv y$ mod
      $n$; thus, for example, vertex 0 = vertex $n$ = vertex $-n$, and so on.
      A pair of vertices $\{a, b\}$ is said to be an opposite pair if and only 
      if $|a - b| = k$ mod $n$. Thus the set of opposite pairs, $P$, is
      $$\{\{x, x + k\} : 1 \le x \le k\} =
        \{\{1, 1 + k\}, \{2, 2 + k\}, \ldots, \{k, 2k\}\}.$$
      Let $r$, $s$ be the usual generators of $D_{2n}$. Viewing these generators
      as members of $S_n$, it follows that (in cycle notation)
      \begin{itemize}
         \item $r =$(1, 2, $\ldots$, $n$) and
         \item $s = \D\prod_{i=2}^k(i, 2k+2-i) = (2, 2k)(3, 2k-1)\cdots(k, k+2)$.
      \end{itemize}

      Now consider a pair of vertices $\{x, x + k\} \in P$. It follows that
      $$r \cdot \{x, x + k\} = \{(x + 1, x + k + 1\} \in P$$
      because $x + k + 1 - (x + 1) = k$. Assume $x = 1$. Since $s$ fixes 1 and
      $k + 1$, it must also fix $\{x, x + 1\}$. Now assume $2 \le x \le k$. Thus
      $$s \cdot \{x, x + k\} = \{2k+2 - x, 2k+2-x-k\} \in P.$$
      We have thus shown that $r$ and $s$ send every opposite pair to another
      opposite pair; since $r$ and $s$ generate it follows that every member of
      $D_{2n}$ maps an opposite pair to another opposite pair. Since we are
      regarding $r$ and $s$ as permutations in $S_n$, axiom 2 immediately
      follows by the composition of permutations. The kernel of this action is
      $\{1, r^k\}$. \qed

                  $g, a \in G$ \textit{do not} satisfy the axioms of a (left)
                  group action of $G$ on itself.

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $G$ is non-abelian. Suppose to the contrary 
      that the map defined by $g \cdot a = ag$ for all $g, a \in G$ satisfies
      the axioms of a (left) group action. Let $x, y, z \in G$. Then it follows
      by axiom 2 of a group action that $x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (xy) \cdot z$.
      Now
      \begin{align*}
         x \cdot (y \cdot z) &= (xy)\cdot z &\Longleftrightarrow \\
         x \cdot (zy) &= z(xy) &\Longleftrightarrow \\
         (zy)x &= z(xy) &\Longleftrightarrow \\
         z(yx) &= z(xy) &\Longleftrightarrow \\
         yx &= xy &\Longleftrightarrow,
      \end{align*}
      so that $G$ is abelian, a contradiction. Thus this map does not define a
      group action. \qed

   \item[1.7.15]  Let $G$ be any group and let $A = G$. Show that the maps
                  defined by $g \cdot a = ag^{-1}$ for all $g, a \in G$
                  \textit{do} satisfy the axioms of a (left) group action of $G$
                  on itself.

      \textbf{Proof.} We shall only verify the second axiom since the first one
      is trivial. Let $x, y, z \in G$. It follows that
      \begin{align*}
         x \cdot (y \cdot z) &= x \cdot (zy^{-1}) \\
            &= zy^{-1}x^{-1} \\
            &= z(xy)^{-1} \\
            &= (xy) \cdot z,
      \end{align*}
      so that axiom 2 holds. Thus this map defines a group action. \qed

   \item[1.7.16]  Let $G$ be any group and let $A = G$. Show that the maps
                  defined by $g \cdot a = gag^{-1}$ for all $g, a \in G$
                  \textit{do} satisfy the axioms of a (left) group action(this
                  action of $G$ on itself is called \textit{conjugation}).

      \textbf{Proof.} We shall only verify the second axiom since the first one
      is trivial. Let $x, y, z \in G$. It follows that
      \begin{align*}
         x \cdot (y \cdot z) &= x \cdot (yzy^{-1}) \\
            &= xyzy^{-1}x^{-1} \\
            &= xyz(xy)^{-1} \\
            &= (xy) \cdot z,
      \end{align*}
      so that axiom 2 holds. Thus this map defines a group action. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.17]  Let $G$ be a group and let $G$ act on itself by left 
                  conjugation, so each $g \in G$ maps $G$ to $G$ by
                  $$x \mapsto gxg^{-1}.$$
                  For fixed $g \in G$, prove that conjugation by $g$ is an
                  isomorphism from $G$ onto itself. Deduce that $x$ and
                  $gxg^{-1}$ have the same order for all $x \in G$ and that for
                  any subset $A$ of $G$, $|A| = |gAg^{-1}|$ (here
                  $gAg^{-1} = \{gag^{-1} : a \in A\})$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $g \in G$. Define $\sigma_g : G \rightarrow G$ by
      $x \mapsto gxg^{-1}$. This map is bijective since it has a 2-sided
      inverse, namely $\sigma_{g^{-1}}$. So it remains to show that $\sigma_g$
      is a homomorphism. This follows immediately because
      \begin{align*}
         \sigma_g(xy) = gxyg^{-1} = gxg^{-1}gyg^{-1} = \sigma_g(x)\sigma_g(y)
      \end{align*}
      for all $x, y \in G$. By Exercise 1.6.2, it follows that
      $|x| = |\sigma_g(x)| = |gxg^{-1}|$ for all $x \in G$. Let $A \subseteq G$.
      Then the map $\alpha_g : A \rightarrow gAg^{-1}$ defined by
      $a \mapsto gag^{-1}$ is also bijective (its 2-sided inverse is
      $\alpha_{g^{-1}}$); thus $|A| = |gAg^{-1}|$. \qed      
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.7.18%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.7.18]  Let $H$ be a group acting on a set $A$. Prove that the
                  relation $\sim$ on $A$ defined by
                  $$a \sim b \quad \text{if and only if} \quad
                    a = hb \quad \text{for some }h \in H$$
                  is an equivalence relation. (For each $x \in A$ the
                  equivalence class of $x$ under $\sim$ is called the
                  \textit{orbit} of $x$ under the action of $H$. The orbits
                  under the action of $H$ partition the set $A$.)

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $a, b, c \in H$.

      \textbf{Reflexivity.} Since $1a = a$, it follows that $a \sim a$, so that
      $\sim$ is reflexive on $A$.

      \textbf{Symmetry.} Suppose $a \sim b$. Then there exists $h \in H$ such
      that $a = hb$. Now $h^{-1}a = h^{-1}hb = 1b = b$, so that $b \sim a$; thus
      $\sim$ is symmetric on $A$.

      \textbf{Transitivity.} Suppose $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$. Then there exist
      $h_1, h_2 \in H$ such that $a = h_1b$ and $b = h_2c$. Thus
      $a = h_1b = h_1(h_2c) = (h_1h_2)c$, so that $a \sim c$; thus $\sim$ is 
      transitive on $A$.

      We can thus conclude that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $A$. \qed

   \item[1.7.19]  Let $H$ be a subgroup of the finite group $G$ and let $H$ act
                  on $G$ (here $A = G$) by left multiplication. Let $x \in G$
                  and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the orbit of $x$ under the action of
                  $H$. Prove that the map
                  $$H \rightarrow \mathcal{O}\quad \text{defined by} \quad
                    h \mapsto hx$$
                  is a bijection (hence all orbits have cardinality $|H|$). From
                  this and the preceding exercise deduce
                  $\textit{Lagrange's Theorem}:$
                  \begin{center}
                     \textit{if $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of
                     $G$ then $|H|$ divides $|G|$}.
                  \end{center}
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $x \in G$ and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the orbit of $x$
      under the action of $H$ on $G$. Consider the map
      $\alpha : H \rightarrow \mathcal{O}$, $h \mapsto hx$. Suppose
      $\alpha(a) = \alpha(b)$. Then it follows that $ax = bx$, so that $a = b$,
      by cancellation. Thus $\alpha$ is injective. Since $G$ is finite, $H$
      must also be finite; thus $\alpha$ is necessarily surjective, and we 
      conclude that $\alpha$ is bijective. That is $|H| = |\mathcal{O}|$. Let
      $|G| = n$. By Exercise 1.7.18, the action of $H$ on $G$ partitions $G$
      into $m$ distinct orbits (there is a finite number of orbits because $G$
      is finite). Since $x$ was arbitrary, it follows that each orbit of this
      action has size $|H|$, so that $m\cdot|H| = |G|$. That is $|H| \mid |G|$.
