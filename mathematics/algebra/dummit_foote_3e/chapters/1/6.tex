                     \item Prove that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all
                           $n \in \Z^+$.

                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \textbf{Proof.} We shall proceed by induction on $n$. It is clear
               that $\varphi(x^1) = \varphi(x)^1$. Now suppose that
               $\varphi(x^k) = \varphi(x)^k$ for some integer $k$. Thus
               \begin{align*}
                  \varphi(x^{k+1}) &= \varphi(x^kx) \\
                     &= \varphi(x^k)\varphi(x)
                        &[\varphi\text{ is a homomorphism}] \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^k\varphi(x) &[\text{Inductive hypothesis}] \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^{k+1},
               \end{align*}
               so that, by Mathematical Induction, $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ 
               for all $n \in \Z^+$. \qed
         \item Since
               $$1 \cdot \varphi(1) = \varphi(1) = \varphi(1 \cdot 1) =
                 \varphi(1)\cdot\varphi(1),$$
               it follows by cancellation that $\varphi(1) = 1$. Thus
               $$\varphi(x)\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(xx^{-1}) =\varphi(1) = 1,$$
               so that $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$. Now let $n$ be a
               positive integer. Then it follows that
               \begin{align*}
                  \varphi(x^{-n}) &= \varphi((x^{-1})^n) \\
                     &= \varphi(x^{-1})^n &[\text{1.6.1(a)}] \\
                     &= (\varphi(x)^{-1})^n \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^{-n}.
               \end{align*}
               Moreover $\varphi(x^0) = 1 = \varphi(x)^0$; thus we can conclude 
               that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n \in \Z$.
      \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.2]   If $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that
                  $|\varphi(x)| = |x|$ for all $x \in G$. Deduce that any two
                  isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order
                  $n$ for each $n \in \Z^+$. Is the result true if $\varphi$ is
                  only assumed to be a homomorphism?

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is a group
      isomorphism. Let $x \in G$. Suppose $|x| = n$. By the preceding exercise, 
      we have that $\varphi(x)^n = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(1) = 1$, so that
      $|\varphi(x)| \le n$. Now suppose that $|\varphi(x)| = m < n$. Then we
      must have that $\varphi(1) = 1 = \varphi(x)^m = \varphi(x^m)$. That is,
      $x^m = 1$ (since $\varphi$ is injective), a contradiction since $|x| = n$.
      Thus $|\varphi(x)| = |x| = n$. Finally suppose that $|x| = \infty$ and
      $|\varphi(x)| = r < \infty$. Then, as previously argued, we must have
      that $x^r = 1$, a contradiction. Thus if $y \in G$, it must follow that
      $|y| = |\varphi(y)|$. \qed

      For a positive integer $n$, we can now exhibit a bijection (using
      $\varphi$) between the elements of $G$ of order $n$ and the elements of
      $H$ of order $n$. Thus any two isomorphic groups must have the same number 
      of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \Z^+$. If $\varphi$ is only 
      assumed to be a homomorphism then the result is not generally true. 
      Consider the homomorphism
      $$\alpha : S_3 \rightarrow \{1\}.$$
      Although $S_3$ has an element of order 2, the trivial group $\{1\}$ has no 
      element of order 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.3]   If $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that
                  $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. If
                  $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism, what additional
                  conditions on $\varphi$ (if any) are sufficient to ensure that
                  if $G$ is abelian, then so is $H$?

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $G$ is abelian. Consider $h_1$ and $h_2$ in $H$.
      Since $\varphi$ is surjective, there exist $g_1$, $g_2 \in G$ such that
      $\varphi(g_1) = h_1$ and $\varphi(g_2) = h_2$. Since $G$ is abelian, we
      have that
      $$h_1h_2 = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_2g_1) = 
        \varphi(g_2)\varphi(g_1) = h_2h_1,$$
      so that $H$ is also abelian.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Now assume that $H$ is abelian. Consider $g_3$ and $g_4$ 
      in $G$. Since $H$ is abelian, we have that
      $$\varphi(g_3g_4) = \varphi(g_3)\varphi(g_4) = \varphi(g_4)\varphi(g_3) =
        \varphi(g_4g_3).$$
      We thus conclude that $g_3g_4 = g_4g_3$ since $\varphi$ is injective. That
      is, $G$ is abelian. \qed

      Finally suppose $\varphi$ is an homomorphism and $G$ is abelian. Looking
      at the first direction of our proof above, we see that restricting
      $\varphi$ to be surjective is sufficient to make $H$ abelian.

   \item[1.6.4]   Prove that the multiplicative groups $\R - \{0\}$ and
                  $\C - \{0\}$ are not isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $\R - \{0\}$ has no element of order 4, and since
      $\C - \{0\}$ has 2 elements ($i$ and $-i$) of order 4, it follows that
      these two multiplicative groups are not isomorphic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.5]   Prove that the additive groups of $\R$ and $\Q$ are not
                  isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $|\R| \neq |\Q|$, it follows that $(\R, +)$ and
      $(\Q, +)$ are not isomorphic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.6]   Prove that the additive groups of $\Z$ and $\Q$ are not
                  isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} First we shall show that $(\Q, +)$ is not cyclic. So
      suppose that $(\Q, +) = \cyc{c}$. Thus there exists an integer $n$ such 
      that $nc = \D\frac{c}{2}$, so that $\D n = \frac{1}{2}$, a contradiction. 
      That is, $(\Q, +)$ is not cyclic. Now suppose to the contrary that
      $\varphi : \Z \rightarrow \Q$ is a homomorphism from $(\Z, +)$ to
      $(\Q, +)$. Let $q \in \Q$ and let $z$ be the unique preimage of $q$ under
      $\varphi$. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         q &= \varphi(z) \\
           &= \varphi(z \cdot 1) \\
           &= z \cdot \varphi(1),  &[1.6.1(a)]
      \end{align*}
      so that $\Q = \cyc{\varphi(1)}$, a contradiction. Thus $(\Z, +)$ and
      $(\Q, +)$ are not isomorphic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.7]   Prove that $D_8$ and $Q_8$ are not isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $D_8$ has exactly 5 elements of order 2 and $Q_8$
      has exactly 1 element of order 2, it follows that these two groups are not
      isomorphic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.8]   Prove that if $n \neq m$, $S_n$ and $S_m$ are not isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $n$ and $m$ be unequal positive integers so that
      $n! \neq m!$; i.e $n! = |S_n| \neq |S_m| = m!$. Thus no bijective map can
      exist between $S_n$ and $S_m$, so that these two groups are not
      isomorphic. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.9]   Prove that $D_{24}$ and $S_4$ are not isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $D_{24}$ has exactly 2 elements of order 4 and $S_4$
      has exactly 6 elements of order 4, it follows that these two groups are
      not isomorphic. \qed

                  $S_\triangle$ and $S_\Omega$ are isomorphic if
                  $|\triangle| = |\Omega|$ as follows: let
                  $\theta : \triangle \rightarrow \Omega$ be a bijection. Define
                  $$\varphi : S_\triangle \rightarrow S_\Omega \qquad
                    \text{by} \qquad \varphi(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ

                  and prove the following:
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item $\varphi$ is well defined, that is, if $\sigma$ is a
                           permutation of $\triangle$ then
                           $\theta\circ\sigma\circ\theta^{-1}$ is a permutation
                           of $\Omega$.
                     \item $\varphi$ is a bijection from $S_\triangle$ onto
                           $S_\Omega$. [Find a 2-sided inverse for $\varphi$.]
                     \item $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, that is,

                  Note the similarity to the \textit{change of basis} or
                  \textit{similarity} transformations for matrices.

      \textbf{Proof.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Let $\sigma \in S_\triangle$. Notice that
               $\varphi(\sigma) = \theta\circ\sigma\circ\theta^{-1}$ maps
               $\Omega$ into $\Omega$, and is also a bijecton since it is a
               composition of bijective maps. Thus
               $\varphi(\sigma) \in S_\Omega$, so that $\varphi$ is well
               defined.
         \item Consider the map
               $$\alpha : S_\Omega \rightarrow S_\triangle \qquad
                 \text{by} \qquad \alpha(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma^{-1} 
                 \circ \theta^{-1} \text{ for all } \sigma \in S_\Omega.$$
               A trivial computation will show us that $\varphi\circ\alpha$ is
               the identity map on $S_\Omega$ and $\alpha\circ\varphi$ is the
               identity map on $S_\triangle$. Thus $\varphi$ is a bijection.
         \item Let $\sigma, \tau \in S_\triangle$. So
               \begin{align*}
                  \varphi(\sigma\circ\tau) &=
                     \theta\circ\sigma\circ\tau\circ\theta^{-1} \\
                     &= \theta\circ\sigma\circ\theta^{-1}\circ\theta\circ
                        \tau\circ\theta^{-1} \\
                     &= \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau),
               \end{align*}

      \textbf{Proof.} Consider the map $f : A \times B \rightarrow B \times A$,
      $(a, b) \mapsto (b, a)$. Now define
      $$g : B \times A\rightarrow A\times B, \quad (b, a) \mapsto (a, b).$$
      So $f$ is bijective since $g$ is its two-sided inverse. Now $f$ is a

      \textbf{Proof.} Proceed as we did in Exercise 1.6.11 with the following
      modification:
      $$f : G \times C \rightarrow A \times H,
        \quad((a, b), c) \mapsto (a, (b, c))$$ and

                  injective then $G \cong \varphi(G)$.

      \textbf{Proof.} The set $\varphi(G)$ is nonempty since it contains
      $\varphi(1) = 1$. So let $h_1, h_2 \in \varphi(G)$. Thus there exist
      $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $\varphi(g_1) = h_1$ and $\varphi(g_2) = h_2$. 
      So
      $$\varphi(g_1g_2^{-1}) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)^{-1} = h_1h_2^{-1} \in
        \varphi(G).$$
      That is $\varphi(G)$ is a subgroup of $H$. Now suppose that $\varphi$ is
      injective and consider the map $\alpha : G \rightarrow \varphi(G)$,
      $g \mapsto \varphi(g)$. Since $\varphi$ is an injective homomorphism, it
      follows that $\alpha$ is also an injective homomorphism. Also it is clear
      that $\alpha$ is onto. Thus $\alpha$ is an isomorphism and we have that
      $G \cong \varphi(G)$. \qed

                  $\varphi$ is a subgroup of $G$. Prove that $\varphi$ is
                  injective if and only if the kernel of $\varphi$ is the
                  identity subgroup of $G$.

      \textbf{Proof 1.} Let ker($\varphi$) be the kernel of $\varphi$. The set
      ker($\varphi$) is not empty because $1_G \in \text{ker}(\varphi)$. Now let
      $x, y \in \text{ker}(\varphi)$. Then we have that
      $$\varphi(xy^{-1}) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)^{-1} = 1_H{1_H}^{-1} = 1_H,$$
      so that $xy^{-1} \in \text{ker}(\varphi)$. That is ker($\varphi$) is a
      subgroup of $G$. \qed

      \textbf{Proof 2.} ($\Rightarrow$) Assume that $\varphi$ is injective. Let
      $x \in \text{ker}(\varphi)$. Thus we have that
      $\varphi(1_G) = \varphi(x) = 1_H$, so that $x = 1_G$ since $\varphi$ is
      one to one. That is ker($\varphi$) = $\{1_G\}$, the identity subgroup of
      $G$.

      ($\Leftarrow$) Assume that ker($\varphi$) = $\{1_G\}$. Suppose that
      $\varphi(g_1) = \varphi(g_2)$ for some $g_1, g_2 \in G$. Then it follows
      that $\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)^{-1} = 1_H$, so that
      $\varphi(g_1{g_2}^{-1}) = 1_H$. Since ker($\varphi$) = $\{1_G\}$, we can
      conclude that $g_1{g_2}^{-1} = 1_G$, so that $g_1 = g_2$; i.e., $\varphi$

      $\alpha : G \rightarrow G$, $g \mapsto g^2$. 

      ($\Leftarrow$) Assume that $G$ is abelian. Then it
      follows that
      \begin{align*}
         \alpha(xy) &= (xy)^2 \\
            &= x^2y^2 &[G \text{ is abelian}] \\
            &= \alpha(x)\alpha(y),
      \end{align*}
      so that $\alpha$ is a homomorphism.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Assume that $\alpha$ is a homomorphism. Then it
      follows that
      \begin{align*}
         x^2y^2 &= \alpha(x)\alpha(y) \\
            &= \alpha(xy) \\
            &= (xy)^2 \\
            &= xyxy,
      \end{align*}
      so that $xxyy = xyxy$. By cancellation we thus have $xy = yx$; i.e, $G$ is
      abelian. \qed

   \item[1.6.19]  Let $G = \{z \in \C : z^n = 1 \text{ for some }n \in \Z^+\}$.
                  Prove that for any fixed integer $k > 1$ the map from $G$ to
                  itself defined by $z \mapsto z^k$ is a surjective homomorphism
                  but is not an isomorphism.

      \textbf{Proof.} Consider an integer $k > 1$ and the map
      $\alpha : G \rightarrow G$, $g \mapsto g^k$. Let $x, y \in G$. The map
      $\alpha$ is a homomorphism since
      $\alpha(xy) = (xy)^k = x^ky^k = \alpha(x)\alpha(y)$. Since $x \in G$, it
      follows that $x^m = 1$ for some positive integer $m$. Notice that
      $x^{1/k} \in G$ since $(x^{1/k})^{km} = 1$. Thus $\alpha$ is onto because
      $\alpha(x^{1/k}) = x$. Now consider the complex number
      $e^{2\pi/k} = \cos2\pi/k + i \sin2\pi/k$. Notice that $e^{2\pi/k} \in G$
      since $(e^{2\pi/k})^k = 1$. Also notice that $e^{2\pi/k} \neq 1$ (since
      $2\pi/k$ is not a multiple of $2\pi$), but we have that
      $\alpha(e^{2\pi/k}) = \alpha(1) = 1$, so that $\alpha$ is not injective; 
      i.e, $\alpha$ is not an isomorphism. \qed

   \item[1.6.20]  Let $G$ be a group and let Aut($G$) be the set of all
                  isomorphisms from $G$ onto $G$. Prove that Aut($G$) is a
                  group under function composition (called the
                  \text{automorphism group} of $G$ and the elements of Aut($G$)
                  are called \text{automorphisms} of $G$).

      \textbf{Proof.}

      \textbf{Closure.} Let $\alpha, \gamma \in \text{Aut}(G)$. Since the
      composition of two bijective functions is also bijective, it follows that
      $\alpha \circ \gamma$ is bijective. Now let $x, y \in G$. It follows that
      $$(\alpha\circ\gamma)(xy) = \alpha(\gamma(xy)) =
         \alpha(\gamma(x)\gamma(y)) = \alpha(\gamma(x))\alpha(\gamma(y)) =
         ((\alpha\circ\gamma)(x))((\alpha\circ\gamma)(y)),$$
      so that $\alpha\circ\gamma)$ is also an isomorphism on $G$, and thus,
      Aut($G$) is closed.

      \textbf{Associativity.} This follows from the associativity of functions.

      \textbf{Identity.} The identity map is the identity of Aut($G$).

      \textbf{Inverse.} Since every map in Aut($G$) is bijective, it follows 
      that every map has a 2-sided inverse.

      Thus we have shown that Aut($G$) is a group under composition. \qed

   \item[1.6.21]  Prove that for each fixed nonzero $k \in \Q$ the map from $\Q$
                  to itself defined by $q \mapsto kq$ is an automorphism of
                  $\Q$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $k$ be a nonzero rational number. Consider the map
      $f : \Q \rightarrow \Q$, $q \mapsto kq$. Let $x, y \in Q$. We have that
      $f(x + y) = k(x + y) = kx + ky = f(x) + f(y)$, so that $f$ is a 
      homomorphism. Now suppose $f(x) = f(y)$, so that $kx = ky$. Since
      $k \neq 0$, we shall multiply the equality $kx = ky$ by $1/k$ to get
      $x = y$; i.e, $f$ is injective. Since $f(x/k) = x$, it follows that $f$ is
      onto, so that $f$ is an automorphism of $\Q$. \qed

                  itself. If $k = -1$ prove that this homomorphism is an
                  isomorphism.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $k$ be an integer, $x, y \in A$. Consider the map
      $f : A \rightarrow A$, $a \mapsto a^k$. Since $A$ is abelian we have that
      $f(xy) = (xy)^k = x^ky^k = f(x)f(y)$, so that $f$ is a homomorphism. Now 
      assume that $k = -1$. In this case, notice that the map $f$ is also the
      2-sided inverse of $f$; thus $f$ is bijective, so that $f$ is an 
      isomorphism. \qed

   \item[1.6.23]  Let $G$ be a finite group which possesses an automorphism
                  $\sigma$ such that $\sigma(g) = g$ if and only if $g = 1$. If
                  $\sigma^2$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$, prove that $G$
                  is abelian (such an automorphism $\sigma$ is called
                  \text{fixed point free} of order 2). [Hint. Show that every
                  element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^{-1}\sigma(x)$
                  and apply $\sigma$ to such an expression.]

      \textbf{Proof.} Consider the map $\alpha : G \rightarrow G$,
      $g \mapsto g^{-1}\sigma(g)$. Suppose that for some $x, y \in G$, we have
      that $\alpha(x) = \alpha(y)$. Then it follows that
      $x^{-1}\sigma(x) = y^{-1}\sigma(y)$, so that
      $yx^{-1} =\nobreak \sigma(y)\sigma(x)^{-1} = \sigma(yx^{-1})$. Since
      $\sigma(g) = g$ if and only if $g = 1$, we must then have that
      $yx^{-1} = 1$; thus $y = x$, so that $\alpha$ is injective; $\alpha$ is
      also surjective since $G$ is finite. So let $z \in G$. Then we must have 
      that $z = h^{-1}\sigma(h)$ for some $h \in G$. So
      $\sigma(z) = \sigma(h^{-1}\sigma(h)) = \sigma(h)^{-1}\sigma^2(h) =
       \sigma(h)^{-1}h = z^{-1}$. We can then conclude by Exercise 1.6.17 that
      $G$ is abelian. \qed

   \item[1.6.24]  Let $G$ be a finite group and let $x$ and $y$ be distinct
                  elements of order 2 in $G$ that generate $G$. Prove that
                  $G \cong D_{2n}$, where $n = |xy|$. [See Exercise 1.2.6]
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $a = xy$. Since $G$ is finite, $|a|$ must also be
      finite. So write $|a| = n$. By Exercise 1.2.6, we have that
      $ax = xa^{-1}$. Also note since $y = x^2y = x(xy) = xa$, the elements
      $a$ and $x$ generate $G$. Thus we have that
      $$G = \cyc{a, x : a^n = x^2 = 1, ax = xa^{-1}}.$$
      By the discussion on Page 38-39 of the Textbook, the map
      $\varphi : D_{2n} \rightarrow G$, given by $\varphi(r) = a$ and
      $\varphi(s) = x$ is an isomorphism. Hence $G \cong D_{2n}$. \qed

                  \end{enumerate}
                  
      \textbf{Proof.}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Consider $T_\theta : \R^2 \rightarrow \R^2$,
               $(x, y) \mapsto (x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta,
               x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta)$, the linear transformation which
               rotates the cartesian plane about the origin in a
               counterclockwise direction by $\theta$ radians. Consider the
               standard basis $\{(1, 0), (0, 1)\}$ for $\R^2$. A simple
               calculation will show us that the matrix of $T_\theta$ with
               respect to the standard basis is $\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cr@{}}
                  $\cos\theta$ & $-\sin\theta$ \\
                  $\sin\theta$ & $\cos\theta$
               \end{tabular}\right)$. 
         \item It suffices to show that $\varphi(r)$ and $\varphi(s)$ satisfy
               (in $GL_2(\R)$) the relations satisfied by $r$ and $s$
               (in $D_{2n}$). It is clear that $\varphi(s)^2$ is the identity
               matrix. Also $\varphi(r)^n$ is the identity matrix because the
               least (positive) number of rotations we need to get back to the
               starting point is $n$. Finally we have that
               $$\varphi(r)\varphi(s) = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}rc@{}}
                  $-\sin\theta$ & $\cos\theta$ \\
                  $\cos\theta$ & $\sin\theta$
               \end{tabular}\right) = \varphi(s)\varphi(r)^{-1},$$
               as desired.
         \item First note that (using induction)
               $$\varphi(r^p) = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cr@{}}
                  $\cos p\theta$ & $-\sin p\theta$ \\
                  $\sin p\theta$ & $\cos p\theta$
               \end{tabular}\right) \qquad \text{for all } p \in \Z.$$
               Now suppose that $\varphi(r^is^j) = \varphi(r^xs^y)$. That is,
               $\varphi(r^i)\varphi(s^j) = \varphi(r^x)\varphi(s^y)$, so that
               $\varphi(r^{i-x}) = \varphi(s^{y-j})$.

               \textbf{Case 1.} $y - j \equiv 0$ mod 2. That is $s^y = s^j$,
               so that $$\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cr@{}}
                  $\cos [(i-x)\theta]$ & $-\sin[(i-x)\theta]$ \\
                  $\sin[(i-x)\theta]$ & $\cos[(i-x)\theta]$
               \end{tabular}\right) = \varphi(r^{i-x}) = \varphi(s^{y-j}) =
               \varphi(1) = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
                  1 & 0 \\
                  0 & 1
               \end{tabular}\right).$$
               It follows that $(i - x)\theta = 2\pi k$ for some integer $k$.
               Recall that $\theta = 2\pi/n$; thus $i - x = nk$ and we have that
               $r^{i-x} = r^{nk} = 1$, so we can conclude that $r^i = r^x$. We
               have thus shown that $r^is^j = r^xs^y$.

               \textbf{Case 2.} $y - j \equiv 1$ mod 2. Now
               $$\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cr@{}}
                  $\cos [(i-x)\theta]$ & $-\sin[(i-x)\theta]$ \\
                  $\sin[(i-x)\theta]$ & $\cos[(i-x)\theta]$
               \end{tabular}\right) = \varphi(r^{i-x}) = \varphi(s^{y-j}) =
               \varphi(s) = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
                  0 & 1 \\
                  1 & 0
               \end{tabular}\right),$$
               a contradiction because $-1 = \sin[(i-x)\theta] = 1$. Hence the
               only possibility is Case 1, wherein we showed that
               $r^is^j = r^xs^y$, so that $\varphi$ is injective.

                  extends to a homomorphism. Prove that $\varphi$ is injective.

      \textbf{Proof.} To show that $\varphi$ extends to an homomorphism, it
      suffices to show that $\varphi(i)$ and $\varphi(j)$ satisfy
      (in $GL_2(\C)$) the relations satisfied by $i$ and $j$ (in $Q_8$). Using
      Exercise 1.5.3, we must then show that $\varphi(i)^2 = \varphi(j)^2$ and
      $\varphi(i)^4 = 1$. These equalities immediately follow using matrix
      multiplication. Now suppose that $\varphi(i^xj^y) = \varphi(i^mj^n$). Then
      it follows that $\varphi(i)^{x-m} = \varphi(j)^{n-y}$. Notice that
      $|\varphi(i)| = |\varphi(j)| = 4$ and that $\varphi(i)^p = \varphi(j)^q$
      if and only if $p \equiv q \equiv 2$ (or 0) mod 4. So we must have that
      $x - m \equiv n - y \equiv 2 $ (or 0) mod 4. In either case, it follows
      that $i^{x - m} = j^{n - y}$. That is $i^xj^y = i^mj^n$, so that
      $\varphi$ is injective. \qed
