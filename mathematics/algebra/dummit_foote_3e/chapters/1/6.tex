   \item[1.6.1]   Let $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all
                           $n \in \Z^+$.

                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \textbf{Proof.} We shall proceed by induction on $n$. It is clear
               that $\varphi(x^1) = \varphi(x)^1$. Now suppose that
               $\varphi(x^k) = \varphi(x)^k$ for some integer $k$. Thus
               \begin{align*}
                  \varphi(x^{k+1}) &= \varphi(x^kx) \\
                     &= \varphi(x^k)\varphi(x)
                        &[\varphi\text{ is a homomorphism}] \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^k\varphi(x) &[\text{Inductive hypothesis}] \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^{k+1},
               \end{align*}
               so that, by Mathematical Induction, $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ 
               for all $n \in \Z^+$. \qed
         \item Since
               $$1 \cdot \varphi(1) = \varphi(1) = \varphi(1 \cdot 1) =
                 \varphi(1)\cdot\varphi(1),$$
               it follows by cancellation that $\varphi(1) = 1$. Thus
               $$\varphi(x)\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(xx^{-1}) =\varphi(1) = 1,$$
               so that $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$. Now let $n$ be a
               positive integer. Then it follows that
               \begin{align*}
                  \varphi(x^{-n}) &= \varphi((x^{-1})^n) \\
                     &= \varphi(x^{-1})^n &[\text{1.6.1(a)}] \\
                     &= (\varphi(x)^{-1})^n \\
                     &= \varphi(x)^{-n}.
               \end{align*}
               Moreover $\varphi(x^0) = 1 = \varphi(x)^0$; thus we can conclude 
               that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n \in \Z$.
      \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.2]   If $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that
                  $|\varphi(x)| = |x|$ for all $x \in G$. Deduce that any two
                  isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order
                  $n$ for each $n \in \Z^+$. Is the result true if $\varphi$ is
                  only assumed to be a homomorphism?

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is a group
      isomorphism. Let $x \in G$. Suppose $|x| = n$. By the preceding exercise, 
      we have that $\varphi(x)^n = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(1) = 1$, so that
      $|\varphi(x)| \le n$. Now suppose that $|\varphi(x)| = m < n$. Then we
      must have that $\varphi(1) = 1 = \varphi(x)^m = \varphi(x^m)$. That is,
      $x^m = 1$ (since $\varphi$ is injective), a contradiction since $|x| = n$.
      Thus $|\varphi(x)| = |x| = n$. Finally suppose that $|x| = \infty$ and
      $|\varphi(x)| = r < \infty$. Then, as previously argued, we must have
      that $x^r = 1$, a contradiction. Thus if $y \in G$, it must follow that
      $|y| = |\varphi(y)|$. \qed

      For a positive integer $n$, we can now exhibit a bijection (using
      $\varphi$) between the elements of $G$ of order $n$ and the elements of
      $H$ of order $n$. Thus any two isomorphic groups must have the same number 
      of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \Z^+$. If $\varphi$ is only 
      assumed to be a homomorphism then the result is not generally true. 
      Consider the homomorphism
      $$\alpha : S_3 \rightarrow \{1\}.$$
      Although $S_3$ has an element of order 2, the trivial group $\{1\}$ has no 
      element of order 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.6.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.6.3]   If $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that
                  $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. If
                  $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism, what additional
                  conditions on $\varphi$ (if any) are sufficient to ensure that
                  if $G$ is abelian, then so is $H$?

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $G$ is abelian. Consider $h_1$ and $h_2$ in $H$.
      Since $\varphi$ is surjective, there exist $g_1$, $g_2 \in G$ such that
      $\varphi(g_1) = h_1$ and $\varphi(g_2) = h_2$. Since $G$ is abelian, we
      have that
      $$h_1h_2 = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_2g_1) = 
        \varphi(g_2)\varphi(g_1) = h_2h_1,$$
      so that $H$ is also abelian.

      ($\Rightarrow$) Now assume that $H$ is abelian. Consider $g_3$ and $g_4$ 
      in $G$. Since $H$ is abelian, we have that
      $$\varphi(g_3g_4) = \varphi(g_3)\varphi(g_4) = \varphi(g_4)\varphi(g_3) =
        \varphi(g_4g_3).$$
      We thus conclude that $g_3g_4 = g_4g_3$ since $\varphi$ is injective. That
      is, $G$ is abelian. \qed

      Finally suppose $\varphi$ is an homomorphism and $G$ is abelian. Looking
      at the first direction of our proof above, we see that restricting
      $\varphi$ to be surjective is sufficient to make $H$ abelian.

   \item[1.6.4]   Prove that the multiplicative groups $\R - \{0\}$ and
                  $\C - \{0\}$ are not isomorphic.

      \textbf{Proof.} Since $\R - \{0\}$ has no element of order 4, and since
      $\C - \{0\}$ has 2 elements ($i$ and $-i$) of order 4, it follows that
      these two multiplicative groups are not isomorphic. \qed

   \item[1.6.5]   Prove that the additive groups of $\R$ and $\Q$ are not
                  isomorphic.

      $(\Q, +)$ are not isomorphic. \qed

                  $|\triangle| = |\Omega|$ as follows: let

                  $$\varphi : S_{\triangle} \rightarrow S_{\Omega} \qquad

                  and prove the following:

                     \item $\varphi$ is well defined, that is, if $\sigma$ is a
