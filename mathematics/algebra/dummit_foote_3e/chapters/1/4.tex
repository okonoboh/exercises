%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.4]   Show that if $n$ is not prime then $\Z/n\Z$ is not a field.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $n$ is not prime. Then there exist positive
      integers $a$ and $b$, with $1 < a \le b < n$, such that $n = ab$. Now
      suppose to the contrary that $\Z/n\Z$ is a field. Since $a$ is not 0 in
      $\Z/n\Z$ it must have a multiplicative inverse, say $a^{-1}$, so that
      $b \equiv a^{-1}(ab) \equiv a^{-1}n \equiv 0$ mod $n$, a contradiction
      since $1 < b < n$. It follows that $\Z/n\Z$ is not a field. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.5]   Show that $GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a
                  finite number of elements.

      \textbf{Proof.} ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $|F| = m$. Let $M_n(F)$ be the
      set of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $F$. Clearly
      $GL_n(F) \subset M_n(F)$; since $|M_n(F)| = m^{n^2}$, it follows that
      $GL_n(F)$ is finite.

      ($\Rightarrow$) We shall instead prove the contrapositive in this
      direction. So suppose $F$ is infinite, so that $F^\times$ is also
      infinite. Then the set $\left\{\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a$ & 0 \\
         0 & 1
      \end{tabular}\right) : a \in F^\times\right\}$ is not only infinite but 
      also a subset of $GL_n(F)$. Thus $GL_n(F)$ is infinite, as desired. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.6]   If $|F| = q$ is finite prove that $|GL_n(F)| < q^{n^2}$.
   
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $M_n(F)$ be the set of all $n \times n$ matrices with
      entries in $F$. Now we have that $|M_n(F)| = q^{n^2}$. Since $GL_n(F)$ is
      a subset of $M_n(F)$ and since $GL_n(F)$ does not contain the zero matrix
      it follows that $GL_n(F)$ is a proper subset of $M_n(F)$ so that
      $|GL_n(F)| < |M_n(F)| = q^{n^2}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.7]   Let $p$ be a prime. Prove that the order of $GL_2(\F_p)$ is
                  $p^4 - p^3 - p^2 + p$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} We shall the use following fact from Linear Algebra: a
      matrix with entries in a field is invertible if and only if its rows are
      linearly independent. So it suffices to count the number of matrices with
      independent rows. Since $|\F_p| = p$, it follows that there are $p^2$
      possible row vectors in $GL_2(\F_p)$. To form an invertible matrix, we
      cannot choose the zero vector, so there are $p^2 - 1$ choices for the
      first row.  Now two vectors are linearly independent if and only they are
      not a multiple of each other. Thus there are $p^2 - p$ for the second row.
      Thus $|GL_2(\F_p)| = (p^2 - 1)(p^2 - p) = p^4 - p^3 - p^2 + p$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.8]   Show that $GL_n(F)$ is non-abelian for any $n \ge 2$ and any
                  $F$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $U_n$ be the $n \times n$ upper triangular matrix with
      1s on and above the main diagonal; similarly, let $L_n$ be the
      $n \times n$ lower triangular matrix with 1s on and below the main
      diagonal. Since $U_n$ and $L_n$ are triangular matrices with 1s on their
      main diagonals, it follows that $\det(U_n) = \det(L_n) = 1$, so that
      $U_n, L_n \in G_n(F)$. Let $(a_{ij}) = U_n \cdot L_n$ and
      $(b_{ij}) = L_n \cdot U_n$. We have that $a_{11} = n \neq 1 = b_{11}$ so
      that $U_n$ and $L_n$ do not commute. Thus $G_n(F)$ is non-abelian. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.9]   Prove that the binary operation of matrix multiplication of
                  $2 \times 2$ matrices with real number entries is associative.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let
      $$X_1 = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}

                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item It follows immediately that $G$ is closed under matrix
               multiplication because
               $$\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}

         \item Since $a \neq 0$ and $c \neq 0$, it follows that $ac \neq 0$
               so that $\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}

         \item Since $G$ is nonempty, it follows by (a) and (b) that $G$ is a
               subgroup of $GL_2(\R)$.
         \item Proof is identical to what we did in (a)$-$(c).

The next exercise introduces the \textit{Heisenberg group} over the field $F$
and develops some of its basic properties. When $F = \R$ this groups plays an
important role in quantum mechanics and signal theory by giving a group
theoretic interpretation (due to H. Weyl) of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Note also that the Heisenberg group may be defined more generally---for example,
with entries in $\Z$.

                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Compute the matrix product $XY$ and deduce that

                           explicit matrices such that $XY \neq YX$ (so that

      \item Using row reduction we find that
            $X^{-1} = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}crr@{}}
               1 & $-a$ & $ac-b$ \\
               0 & 1 & $-c$ \\
               0 & 0 & 1
            \end{tabular}\right) \in H(F)$, so that $H(F)$ is closed under
            inverses.
      \item Let $Z = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

               0 & 0 & 1
            \end{tabular}\right)$. Thus we have that

               \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

            X(YZ).
            \end{align*}
            Hence $H(F)$ is associative under matrix multiplication. Since
            $H(F)$ contains the 3 by 3 identity matrix, it follows by (a) and
            (b) that $H(F)$ is a group. Since we have $|F|$ choices for each of 
            $a$, $b$, and $c$, it follows that $|H(F)| = |F|^3$.

      \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $X = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
               1 & $a$ & $b$ \\
               0 & 1 & $c$ \\
               0 & 0 & 1
            \end{tabular}\right)$ be a nonidentity matrix in $H(\R)$. Also let
            $P_n(i,j)$ denote the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of
            $X^n$. So we have the following three cases:

            \textbf{Case 1.} $a \neq 0$. Notice that for every positive integer
            $n$, $P_n(1,2) = na \neq 0$, so that $X^n$ is not the identity
            element. Thus $|X| = \infty$.

            \textbf{Case 2.} $c \neq 0$. Similarly $P_n(2,3) = nc \neq 0$, so 
            that $X^n$ is not the identity element. Thus $|X| = \infty$.

            \textbf{Case 3.} $b \neq 0$ and $a = c = 0$. Also
            $P_n(1,3) = nb \neq 0$, so that $X^n$ is not the identity element. 
            Thus $|X| = \infty$.

            As we have shown above, every nonidentity element in $H(\R)$ is of
            infinite order. \qed
