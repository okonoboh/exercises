%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.4]   Show that if $n$ is not prime then $\Z/n\Z$ is not a field.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $n$ is not prime. Then there exist positive
      integers $a$ and $b$, with $1 < a \le b < n$, such that $n = ab$. Now
      suppose to the contrary that $\Z/n\Z$ is a field. Since $a$ is not 0 in
      $\Z/n\Z$ it must have a multiplicative inverse, say $a^{-1}$, so that
      $b \equiv a^{-1}(ab) \equiv a^{-1}n \equiv 0$ mod $n$, a contradiction
      since $1 < b < n$. It follows that $\Z/n\Z$ is not a field. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.5]   Show that $GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a
                  finite number of elements.

      \textbf{Proof.} ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $|F| = m$. Let $M_n(F)$ be the
      set of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $F$. Clearly
      $GL_n(F) \subset M_n(F)$; since $|M_n(F)| = m^{n^2}$, it follows that
      $GL_n(F)$ is finite.

      ($\Rightarrow$) We shall instead prove the contrapositive in this
      direction. So suppose $F$ is infinite, so that $F^\times$ is also
      infinite. Then the set $\left\{\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a$ & 0 \\
         0 & 1
      \end{tabular}\right) : a \in F^\times\right\}$ is not only infinite but 
      also a subset of $GL_n(F)$. Thus $GL_n(F)$ is infinite, as desired. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.6]   If $|F| = q$ is finite prove that $|GL_n(F)| < q^{n^2}$.
   
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $M_n(F)$ be the set of all $n \times n$ matrices with
      entries in $F$. Now we have that $|M_n(F)| = q^{n^2}$. Since $GL_n(F)$ is
      a subset of $M_n(F)$ and since $GL_n(F)$ does not contain the zero matrix
      it follows that $GL_n(F)$ is a proper subset of $M_n(F)$ so that
      $|GL_n(F)| < |M_n(F)| = q^{n^2}$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.7]   Let $p$ be a prime. Prove that the order of $GL_2(\F_p)$ is
                  $p^4 - p^3 - p^2 + p$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} We shall the use following fact from Linear Algebra: a
      matrix with entries in a field is invertible if and only if its rows are
      linearly independent. So it suffices to count the number of matrices with
      independent rows. Since $|\F_p| = p$, it follows that there are $p^2$
      possible row vectors in $GL_2(\F_p)$. To form an invertible matrix, we cannot choose the
      zero vector, so there are $p^2 - 1$ choices for the first row.  Now two
      vectors are linearly independent if and only they are not a multiple of
      each other. Thus there are $p^2 - p$ for the second row. Thus 
      $|GL_2(\F_p)| = (p^2 - 1)(p^2 - p) = p^4 - p^3 - p^2 + p$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.8]   Show that $GL_n(F)$ is non-abelian for any $n \ge 2$ and any
                  $F$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let $U_n$ be the $n \times n$ upper triangular matrix with
      1s on and above the main diagonal; similarly, let $L_n$ be the
      $n \times n$ lower triangular matrix with 1s on and below the main
      diagonal. Since $U_n$ and $L_n$ are triangular matrices with 1s on their
      main diagonals, it follows that $\det(U_n) = \det(L_n) = 1$, so that
      $U_n, L_n \in G_n(F)$. Let $(a_{ij}) = U_n \cdot L_n$ and
      $(b_{ij}) = L_n \cdot U_n$. We have that $a_{11} = n \neq 1 = b_{11}$ so
      that $U_n$ and $L_n$ do not commute. Thus $G_n(F)$ is non-abelian. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.9]   Prove that the binary operation of matrix multiplication of
                  $2 \times 2$ matrices with real number entries is associative.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Let
      $$X_1 = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a_1$ & $b_1$ \\
         $c_1$ & $d_1$
      \end{tabular}\right),
      X_2 = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a_2$ & $b_2$ \\
         $c_2$ & $d_2$
      \end{tabular}\right), \text{ and }
      X_3 = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a_3$ & $b_3$ \\
         $c_3$ & $d_3$
      \end{tabular}\right)$$
      be real matrices. Then we have that
      \begin{align*}
         (X_1X_2)X_3 &= \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
         $a_1a_2 + b_1c_2$ & $b_1$ \\

                           \end{tabular}\right)$ to show that $G$ is closed under
                           matrix multiplication.
                     \item Find the matrix inverse of

The next exercise introduces the \textit{Heisenberg group} over the field $F$
and develops some of its basic properties. When $F = \R$ this groups plays an
important role in quantum mechanics and signal theory by giving a group
theoretic interpretation (due to H. Weyl) of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Note also that the Heisenberg group may be defined more generally---for example,
with entries in $\Z$.
