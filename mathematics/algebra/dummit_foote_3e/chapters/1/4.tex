The next exercise introduces the \textit{Heisenberg group} over the field $F$
and develops some of its basic properties. When $F = \R$ this groups plays an
important role in quantum mechanics and signal theory by giving a group
theoretic interpretation (due to H. Weyl) of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Note also that the Heisenberg group may be defined more generally---for example,
with entries in $\Z$.

\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%1.4.11%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[1.4.11]  Let $H(F) = \left\{\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
                     1 & $a$ & $b$ \\
                     0 & 1 & $c$ \\
                     0 & 0 & 1
                  \end{tabular}\right) : a, b, c \in F\right\}$---called the
                  \textit{Heisenberg group} over $F$. Let
                  $X = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
                     1 & $a$ & $b$ \\
                     0 & 1 & $c$ \\
                     0 & 0 & 1
                  \end{tabular}\right)$ and $Y =\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
                     1 & $d$ & $e$ \\
                     0 & 1 & $f$ \\
                     0 & 0 & 1
                  \end{tabular}\right)$ be elements of $H(F)$.

                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Compute the matrix product $XY$ and deduce that
                           $H(F)$ is closed under matrix multiplication. Exhibit
                           explicit matrices such that $XY \neq YX$ (so that
                           $H(F)$ is always non-abelian).
                     \item Find an explicit formula for the matrix inverse
                           $X^{-1}$ and deduce that $H(F)$ is closed under
                           inverses.
                     \item Prove the associative law for $H(F)$ and deduce that
                           $H(F)$ is a group of order $|F|^3$. 

                           (Do not assume that matrix multiplication is 
                           associative).
                     \item Find the order of each element of the finite group
                           $H(\Z/2\Z)$.
                     \item Prove that every nonidentity element of the group
                           $H(\R)$ has infinite order.
                  \end{enumerate}
