   \item[7.4.32]  Let $I$ be an ideal of the commutative ring $R$ and define
                  $$\text{Jac $I$ to be the intersection of all maximal ideals
                     of $R$ that contain $I$}$$
                  where the convention is that Jac $R = R$. (If $I$ is the zero
                  ideal, Jac 0 is called the \textit{Jacobson radical} of the
                  ring $R$, so Jac $I$ is the preimage in $R$ of the Jacobson
                  radical of $R/I$.)
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that Jac $I$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$.
                     \item Prove that $\text{rad } I \subseteq \text{Jac }I$,
                           where rad $I$ is the radical of $I$ defined in
                           Exercise 7.4.30.
                     \item Let $n > 1$ be an integer. Describe Jac $n\Z$ in
                           terms of the prime factorization of $n$.
                  \end{enumerate}

   \item[7.4.33]  Let $R$ be the ring of all continuous functions from the
                  closed interval $[0, 1]$ to $\R$ and for each $c \in [0, 1]$
                  let $M_c = \{f \in R : f(c) = 0\}$ (recall that $M_c$ was
                  shown to be a maximal ideal of $R$).
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that if $M$ is \textit{any} maximal ideal of
                           $R$ then there is a real number $c \in [0, 1]$ such
                           that $M = M_c$.
                     \item Prove that if $b$ and $c$ are distinct points in
                           $[0, 1]$ then $M_b \neq M_c$.
                     \item Prove that $M_c$ is not equal to the principal ideal
                           generated by $x - c$.
                     \item Prove that $M_c$ is not a finitely generated ideal.
                  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The preceding exercise shows that there is a bijection between the
\textit{points} of the closed interval $[0, 1]$ and the set of
\textit{maximal ideals} in the ring $R$ of all continuous functions on $[0, 1]$
given by $c \leftrightarrow M_c$. For any subset $X$ of $\R$ or, more generally,
for any completely regular topological space $X$, the map $c \mapsto M_c$ is an
\textit{injection} from $X$ to the set of maximal ideals of $R$, where $R$ is
the ring of all bounded continuous real valued functions on $X$ and $M_c$ is the 
maximal ideal of functions that vanish at $c$. Let $\beta(X)$ be the set of
maximal ideals of $R$. One can put a topology on $\beta(X)$ in such a way that
if we identity $X$ with its image in $\beta(X)$ then $X$ (in its given topology)
becomes a subspace of $\beta(X)$. Moreover, $\beta(X)$ is a compact space under
this topology and is called the \textit{Stone-$\check{C}$ech compactification}
of $X$.

   \item[7.4.34]  Let $R$ be the ring of all continuous functions from $\R$ to
                  $\R$ and for each $c \in \R$ let $M_c$ be the maximal ideal
                  $\{f \in R : f(c) = 0\}$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Let $I$ be the collection of functions $f(x)$ in $R$
                           with \textit{compact support} (i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for
                           $|x|$ sufficiently large). Prove that $I$ is an ideal
                           of $R$ that is not a prime ideal.
                     \item Let $M$ be a maximal ideal of $R$ containing $I$
                           (properly, by (a)). Prove that $M \neq M_c$ for any
                           $c \in \R$ (cf. the preceding exercise).

   \item[7.4.35]  Let $A = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ be a nonzero finitely
                  generated ideal of $R$. Prove that there is an ideal $B$ which
                  is maximal with respect to the property that it does not
                  contained $A$. [Use Zorn's Lemma.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.35%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.36]  Assume $R$ is commutative. Prove that the set of prime ideals
                  in $R$ has a minimal element with respect to inclusion
                  (possibly the zero ideal). [Use Zorn's Lemma.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.36%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.37]  A commutative ring $R$ is called a \textit{local ring} if it
                  has a unique maximal ideal. Prove that if $R$ is a local ring
                  with maximal ideal $M$ then every element of $R - M$ is a
                  unit. Prove conversely that if $R$ is a commutative ring with
                  1 in which the set of nonunits forms an ideal of $M$, then $R$
                  is a local ring with unique maximal ideal $M$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.37%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.38]  Prove that the ring of all rational numbers whose denominators
                  is odd is a local ring whose unique maximal ideal is the
                  principal ideal generated by 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.39%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.39]  Following the notation of Exercise 7.1.26, ket $K$ be a field,
                  let $\nu$ be a discrete valuation on $K$ and let $R$ be the
                  valuation ring of $\nu$. For each integer $k \ge 0$ define
                  $A_k = \{r \in R : \nu(r) \ge k\} \cup \{0\}$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $A_k$ is a principal ideal and that
                           $A_0 \supseteq A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq \cdots$.
                     \item Prove that if $I$ is any nonzero ideal of $R$, then
                           $I = A_k$ for some $k \ge 0$. Deduce that $R$ is a
                           local ring with unique maximal ideal $A_1$.
                  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.40%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.40]  Assume $R$ is commutative. Prove that the following are
                  equivalent: (see also Exercises 7.1.13 and 7.1.14)
                  \begin{enumerate}\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\roman{enumii})}
                     \item $R$ has exactly one prime ideal
                     \item every element of $R$ is either nilpotent or a unit
                     \item $R/\mathfrak{N}(R)$ is a field (cf. Exercise 7.3.29).
                  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.41%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.41]  A proper ideal $Q$ of the commutative ring $R$ is called
                  \textit{primary} if whenever $ab \in Q$ and $a \notin Q$ then
                  $b^n \in Q$ for some positive integer $n$. (Note the symmetry
                  between $a$ and $b$ in this definition implies that if $Q$ is
                  a primary ideal and $ab \in Q$ with \textit{neither} $a$ nor
                  $b$ in $Q$, then a positive power of $a$ and a positive power
                  of $b$ both lie in $Q$.) Establish the following facts about
                  primary ideals.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item The primary ideals of $\Z$ are 0 and $(p^n)$, where
                           $p$ is a prime and $n$ is a positive integer.
                     \item Every prime ideal of $R$ is a primary ideal.
                     \item An ideal $Q$ of $R$ is primary if and only if every
                           zero divisor in $R/Q$ is a nilpotent element of
                           $R/Q$.
                     \item If $Q$ is a primary ideal then rad($Q$) is a prime
                           ideal (cf. Exercise 7.4.30).
                  \end{enumerate}
