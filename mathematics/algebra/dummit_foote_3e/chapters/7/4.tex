   \item[7.4.1]   Let $L_j$ be the left ideal of $M_n(R)$ consisting of
                  arbitrary entries in the $j^{\text{th}}$ column and zero in
                  all other entries and let $E_{ij}$ be the element of $M_n(R)$
                  whose $i, j$ entry is 1 and whose other entries are all 0. 
                  Prove that $L_j = M_n(R)E_{ij}$ for any $i$.
                  [See Exercise 7.2.6]

      \textbf{Proof.} Fix $i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, where $n \in \Z^+$.

      \begin{itemize}
         \item ($\subseteq$) Let $A \in L_j$. By definition of $L_j$, the
               $j^{\text{th}}$ column of $A$ is arbitrary and every other entry 
               is zero. Thus it follows by Exercise 7.2.6(b) that
               $A = (A\cdot E_{ji})E_{ij}$, so that
               $L_j \subseteq M_n(R)E_{ij}$.

         \item ($\supseteq$) It follows immediately from Exercise 7.2.6(b) that
               $L_j \supseteq M_n(R)E_{ij}$.
      \end{itemize}
      Thus conclude that $L_j = M_n(R)E_{ij}$. \qed

   \item[7.4.2]   Assume $R$ is commutative. Prove that the augmentation ideal
                  in the group ring $RG$ is generated by $\{g - 1 : g \in G\}$.
                  Prove that if $G = \cyc{\sigma}$ is cyclic then the 
                  augmentation ideal is generated by $\sigma - 1$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\}$,
      $I = (g_1 - 1, g_2 - 1, \ldots, g_n - 1)$, and let $K$ be the augmentation 
      ideal of $RG$. First we want to show that $K = I$.

      \begin{itemize}
         \item ($\subseteq$) Let $r \in K$. Then $r = r_1g_1 + \cdots + r_ng_n$
               for some $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in R$. Since $r \in K$, it follows
               that $r_1 + \cdots + r_n = 0$. Thus
               \begin{align*}
                  r &= r_1g_1 + \cdots + r_ng_n - 0 \\
                    &= r_1g_1 + \cdots + r_ng_n - (r_1 + \cdots + r_n) \\
                    &= r_1g_1 - r_1 + \cdots + r_ng_n - r_n \\
                    &= r_1(g_1 - 1) + \cdots + r_n(g_n - 1) \in I,
               \end{align*}
               so that $K \subseteq I$.

         \item ($\supseteq$) To show that $K \supseteq I$, it suffices to show
               that $K$ contains the generators of $I$. But this follows
               immediately since the sum of the coefficients of the generators
               equal 0, so that $g_i - 1 \in K$ for $1 \le i \le n$. That is,
               $K \supseteq I$.
      \end{itemize}
      We conclude that $K = I$. Now suppose that $G = \cyc{\sigma}$ is cyclic, 
      where $|\sigma| = m \in \Z^+$. As we showed above,
      $K = (\sigma - 1, \sigma^2 - 1, \ldots, \sigma^{m-1} - 1)$. Consider one
      of the generators of $K$, say $\sigma^i - 1$, where $1 \le i \le m - 1$.
      Since
      $$(\sigma^i - 1) = (\sigma^{i-1} + \sigma^{i-2} + \cdots + \sigma + 1)
        (\sigma - 1),$$
      it follows that every generator of $K$ is an element of the ideal
      generated by $\sigma - 1$. Hence that $K = (\sigma - 1)$. \qed

   \item[7.4.4]   Assume $R$ is commutative. Prove that $R$ is a field if and
                  only if 0 is a maximal ideal.

      \textbf{Proof.}

      ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that 0 is a maximal ideal of $R$. Let $I$ be a
      nonzero ideal of $R$. Now $I$ contains the zero ideal since every ideal
      contains the zero ideal; but since the zero ideal is maximal in $R$, it
      follows that $I = 0$ or $I = R$; thus the only ideals of $R$ are trivial,
      so that $R$ is a field by Proposition 7.9(2).

      ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $R$ is a field, so that, by Proposition
      7.9(2), its only ideals are 0 and R. That is, the only ideal properly
      containing 0 is $R$, so that 0 is a maximal ideal in $R$.

   \item[7.4.5]   Prove that if $M$ is an ideal such that $R/M$ is a field then
                  $M$ is a maximal ideal (do not asssume $R$ is commutative).

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $M$ is an ideal such that $R/M$ is a field.
      Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ such that $M$ is a proper subset of $I$. It
      suffices to show that $I = R$. Since $M$ is properly contained in $I$,
      there exists $i \in I$ such that $i \notin M$. Thus $i + M$ is nonzero in
      $R/M$, and since $R/M$ is a field, $ij + M = 1 + M$ for some $j \in R$. 
      That is, $ij - 1 = m$ for some $m \in M$, or equivalently, $ij - m = 1$. 
      But since $I$ is an ideal of $R$ and $i \in I$, it follows that
      $ij \in I$; also since $M \subset I$, it follows that $1 = ij - m \in I$, 
      so that $I = R$ by Proposition 7.9(1). Thus $M$ is a maximal ideal in $R$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.6]   Prove that $R$ is a division ring if and only if its only left
                  ideals are (0) and $R$. (The analogous result holds when
                  ``left" is replaced by ``right.")

      \textbf{Proof.}

      $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that the only left ideals of $R$ are (0) and $R$.
      Let $x$ be a nonzero element in $R$ and let $Rx$ be the left ideal
      generated by $x$. Since $x \neq 0$, it follows that $Rx \neq \{0\}$, so
      that $Rx = R$; thus $1 \in Rx$, so that $1 = yx$ for some nonzero
      $y \in R$. Similarly $Ry = R$, so that $zy = 1$ for some $z \in R$. Thus
      $z \cdot 1 = z(yx) = (zy)x = 1 \cdot x = x$. Thus $yx = xy = 1$; that is,
      every nonzero element in $R$ is a unit.

      $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $R$ is a division ring. Let $x$ be a unit in
      $R$ and let $r \in R$. Then
      $$r = r \cdot 1 = r(x^{-1}x) = (rx^{-1})x \in Rx,$$
      so that $R \subseteq Rx$; inclusion in the other direction is trivial, so
      $R = Rx$. Thus the left ideal generated by every unit in $R$ is all of
      $R$. Conclude that the only left ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and $R$. \qed

   \item[7.4.7]   Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1. Prove that the principal
                  ideal generated by $x$ in the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is a
                  prime ideal if and only if $R$ is an integral domain. Prove
                  that $(x)$ is a maximal ideal if and only if $R$ is a field.

      \textbf{Proof.} The map $\varphi : R[x] \rightarrow R$, defined by
      $r(x) \mapsto r(0)$, is a surjective homomorphism with kernel $(x)$; so
      it follows by the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings that
      $R[x]/(x) \cong R$. Proposition 7.13 says that $(x)$ is a prime ideal in
      $R[x]$ if and only if $R[x]/(x)$ is an integral domain. Since $R$ is 
      isomorphic to $R[x]/(x)$, conclude that $(x)$ is a prime ideal in $R[x]$
      if and only if $R$ is an integral domain. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.4.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.4.8]   Let $R$ be an integral domain. Prove that $(a) = (b)$ for some
                  elements $a, b \in R$, if and only if $a = ub$ for some unit
                  $u$ of $R$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.}
      
      $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $(a) = (b)$ for some elements $a, b \in R$. If
      $a = 0$, then $b = 0$, so $a = 1 \cdot b$; now assume that $a$ and $b$ are
      nonzero. Particularly, we have that $a \in (b)$ and $b \in (a)$. Thus
      $a = bx$ and $b = ay$ for some $x, y \in R$. So $a = bx = ayx$, so that
      $a(1 - yx) = 0$. Since $R$ is an integral domain and since $a \neq 0$, it
      follows that $1 - yx = 0$; that is, $xy = 1$, or equivalently, $x$ and
      $y$ are units in $R$.
      
      $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $a = bu$ for some $a, b, u \in R$, where $u$
      is a unit. Now we want to show that $(a) = (b)$.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item ($\subseteq$) Let $x \in (a)$. Then $x = at$ for some $t \in R$,
               so that $x = at = (bu)t = b(ut) \in (b)$, and thus,
               $(a) \subseteq (b)$.
         \item ($\supseteq$) Let $y \in (b)$. Then $y = bs$ for some $s \in R$,
               so that $y = bs = (au^{-1})s = a(u^{-1}s) \in (a)$, and thus,
               $(a) \supseteq (b)$.
      \end{itemize}
      So we have that $(a) = (b)$.  \qed

   \item[7.4.9]   Let $R$ be the ring of all continuous functions on $[0, 1]$
                  and let $I$ be the collection of functions $f(x)$ in $R$ with
                  $f(1/3) = f(1/2) = 0$. Prove that $I$ is an ideal of $R$ but
                  is not a prime ideal.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} $I$ is nonempty because it contains the zero function, so
      let $f, g \in I$. First we will show that $I$ is an ideal of $R$.
      
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{closure under subtraction:} Since
               $$(f - g)(1/3) = f(1/3) - g(1/3) = 0 =
                 f(1/2) - g(1/2) = (f - g)(1/2),$$
               it follows that $f - g \in I$, so that $I$ is closed under
               subtraction.
         \item \textbf{closure under multiplication $R$:} Let $h \in R$. The
               function $h \cdot f$ is in $I$ because
               $$(h\cdot f)(1/3) = h(1/3)f(1/3) = 0 =
                  h(1/2)f(1/2) = (h\cdot f)(1/2).$$
                  
               Thus  $I$ is closed under multiplication by $R$.
      \end{itemize}
     
      Conclude that $I$ is an ideal of $R$. Now let $p(x) = 3x - 1$ and
      $r(x) = 2x - 1$ be functions in $R$. We have that $p(x)r(x) \in I$, but
      neither $p$ nor $r$ is in $I$; thus $I$ is not a prime ideal of $I$. \qed

                  integral domain.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $P$ has no zero divisors and is a prime ideal
      of $R$. Suppose $ab = 0$ for some $a, b \in R$. Then since $0 \in P$, it
      follows that $ab \in P$, so that $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ since $P$ has no zero
      divisors. \qed

   \item[7.4.11]  Assume $R$ is commutative. Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of $R$
                  and assume $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ that contains $IJ$ (for
                  example, if $P$ contains $I \cap J$). Prove either $I$ or $J$
                  is contained in $P$.
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $I$ is not contained in $P$. It suffices to
      show that $J \subseteq P$. Since $I \not\subseteq P$, there exists
      $i \in I$ such that $i \notin P$. Let $j \in J$. Since $P$ contains $IJ$,
      it follows that $ij\in P$. Since $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$, we have that
      $i \in P$ or $j \in P$; but $i \notin P$, so we conclude that $j \in P$.
      Thus, $P \supseteq J$. \qed

\noindent The preceding exercise shows that there is a bijection between the
\textit{points} of the closed interval $[0, 1]$ and the set of
\textit{maximal ideals} in the ring $R$ of all continuous functions on $[0, 1]$
given by $c \leftrightarrow M_c$. For any subset $X$ of $\R$ or, more generally,
for any completely regular topological space $X$, the map $c \mapsto M_c$ is an
\textit{injection} from $X$ to the set of maximal ideals of $R$, where $R$ is
the ring of all bounded continuous real valued functions on $X$ and $M_c$ is the 
maximal ideal of functions that vanish at $c$. Let $\beta(X)$ be the set of
maximal ideals of $R$. One can put a topology on $\beta(X)$ in such a way that
if we identity $X$ with its image in $\beta(X)$ then $X$ (in its given topology)
becomes a subspace of $\beta(X)$. Moreover, $\beta(X)$ is a compact space under
this topology and is called the \textit{Stone-$\check{C}$ech compactification}
of $X$.
