                  $\psi(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots) = (0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $\varphi\psi$ is the identity of $R$ but
                           $\psi\varphi$ is not the identity of $R$ (i.e.,
                           $\psi$ is a \textit{right inverse} for $\varphi$ but
                           not a left inverse).
                     \item Exhibit infinitely many right inverses for $\varphi$.
                     \item Find a nonzero element $\pi$ in $R$ such that
                           $\varphi\pi = 0$ but $\pi\varphi \neq 0$.
                     \item Prove that there is no nonzero element
                           $\lambda \in R$ such that $\lambda\varphi = 0$ (i.e.,
                           $\varphi$ is a left zero divisor but not a right zero
                           divisor).
