   \item[7.2.2]   Let $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ be an
                  element of the polynomial ring $R[x]$. Prove that $p(x)$ is a
                  zero divisor in $R[x]$ if and only if there is a nonzero 
                  $b \in R$ such that $bp(x) = 0$. [Let $g(x) = b_mx^m +
                  b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0$ be a nonzero polynomial of
                  minimal degree such that $g(x)p(x) = 0$. Show that
                  $b_ma_n = 0$ and so $a_ng(x)$ is a polynomial of degree less
                  than $m$ that also gives 0 when multiplied by $p(x)$. Conclude
                  that $a_ng(x) = 0$. Apply a similar argument to show by
                  induction on $i$ that $a_{n-i}g(x) = 0$ for
                  $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$, and show that this implies
                  $b_mp(x) = 0$.]

      \textbf{Proof.} ($\Rightarrow$) Let $S$ be the set of degrees of nonzero
      polynomials $h(x) \in R[x]$ such that $p(x)h(x) = 0$. The set $S$ is
      nonempty because $p(x)$ is a zero divisor; thus $S$ has a minimum element
      by the Well Ordering Principle. Let
      $$g(x) = b_mx^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0 \in R[x]$$
      such that degree$(g(x)) = m = \min(S)$. We now want to show by induction
      on $i$ that $a_{n-i}g(x) = 0$ for each nonnegative integer $i$, where
      $a_t$ is defined to be 0 for each negative integer $t$. For a nonnegative
      integer $i$, let $P(i)$ denote the statement: $a_{n-i}g(x) = 0$.

      \textbf{Base Case.} $i = 0$. Since $p(x)g(x) = 0$, it follows that the
      coefficients of $p(x)g(x)$ are all zero; particularly, we have that
      $a_nb_m = 0$; if $a_ng(x) \neq 0$, then $a_ng(x) \in S$ because
      $a_ng(x)p(x) = 0$, a contradiction because
      $\text{degree}(a_ng(x)) < \text{degree}(g(x)) = \min(S)$.
      Thus $a_ng(x) = 0$, so that $P(0)$ holds.

      \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis.} Assume that $P(0), P(1), \ldots, P(j-1)$
      are true for some positive integer $j$. We want to show that $P(j)$ holds.
      Observe that if $j \ge n + 1$, then $a_{n - j} = 0$ since $n - j < 0$, so
      that $P(j)$ holds. Hence we can assume that $1 \le j \le n$. The inductive
      hypothesis tells us that $a_{n-i}g(x) = 0$ so that
      \begin{equation} \label{7_2_2_1}
         a_{n-i}b_m = a_{n-i}b_{m-1} = \cdots = a_{n-i}b_0 = 0
      \end{equation}
      for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, j - 1$. The coefficient of $x^{m+j}$ in $p(x)g(x)$
      is
      \begin{equation*}
         \left\{
            \begin{array}{lcl}
               b_ma_j + b_{m-1}a_{j+1} + \cdots + b_{m-n+j}a_n &= 0 & \text{if }
                  m + j \ge n,\\
               b_ma_j + b_{m-1}a_{j+1} + \cdots + b_0a_{m+j} &= 0 & \text{if }
                  m + j < n
            \end{array} \right.
      \end{equation*}
      It follows by \eqref{7_2_2_1} that $b_ma_j = 0$, so that $a_jg(x)$ is a
      polynomial in $R[x]$ of degree less than $\min(S)$. The minimality of
      $\min(S)$ tells us that $a_jg(x) = 0$ (since otherwise $a_jg(x)$ would be
      a member of $S$ contradicting the minimality of $\min(S)$); i.e., $P(j)$
      holds. It follow by induction that $P(i)$ holds for every nonnegative
      integer $i$. Particularly, we have that $P(0), \ldots, P(n)$ hold so
      that $a_ng(x) = a_{n-1}g(x) = \cdots = a_0g(x) = 0$; i.e.,
      $$a_{n}b_m = a_{n-1}b_m = \cdots = a_{0}b_m = 0,$$
      and thus
      $b_mp(x) = 0$. Since $\text{degree}(g(x)) = m$, it follows that
      $b_m \neq 0$.

      $(\Leftarrow)$ This follows from the definition of a zero divisor. \qed

                  \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $a = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$,
               $b = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nx^n$, and
               $c = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n \in R[[x]]$.

               ($R[[x]]$ is an additive abelian group.) Closure and asociativity
               of addition follows because $R$ is closed and associative under
               addition. The 0 of $R$ is also the 0 of $R[[x]]$; the additive
               inverse of a sum is the resulting sum wherein the coefficients of
               the original sum have been replaced with their additive inverses
               in $R$. Thus $(R[[x]], +)$ is an additive abelian group.

               ($R[[x]]$ is closed under multiplication.) This follows from the
               closure of $R$ under multiplication.

               ($R[[x]]$ is commutative.) We have that
               \begin{align*}

         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $a = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty x^n \in R[[x]]$. The
               polynomial $1 - x$ is a unit in $R[[x]]$ because
               \begin{align*}
                  (1 - x)(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots) &= 1(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots) -
                     x(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots) \\
                     &= (1 + x + x^2 + \cdots) - (x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots) \\
                     &= (1 + a) - a = 1.
               \end{align*} \qed
         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $a = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_nx^n \in R[[x]]$.

               $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $a_0$ is a unit in $R$. Consider the
               element $b = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_nx^n \in R[[x]]$, where
               $b_0 = a_0^{-1}$ and $b_i = -(a_ib_0 + a_{i-1}b_1 + \cdots +
                a_1b_{i-1})a_0^{-1}$ for each $i \ge 1$. Thus the coefficient of
               $x^i$ in $ab$ is 0 for each $i \ge 1$ and the constant term in
               $ab$ is $a_0b_0 = 1$, so that $ab = 1$. Thus $a$ is a unit with
               inverse $b$.

               $(\Rightarrow)$ Now suppose conversely that $a$ is a unit in
               $R[[x]]$. Thus there exists
               $c = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_nx^n \in R[[x]]$ such that $ac = 1$.
               Particularly we have that $a_0c_0 = 1$, so that $a_0$ is a unit
               in $R$.\qed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%7.2.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.2.4]   Prove that if $R$ is an integral domain then the ring of
                  formal power series $R[[x]]$ is also an integral domain.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $R$ is an integral domain. Let
      $$a = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots \text{ and }
        b = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \cdots$$
      be nonzero elements in $R[[x]]$. Let $a_i$ and $b_j$ be the smallest
      nonnegative integers $i$ and $j$ such that $a_i$ and $b_j$ are both
      nonzero. The coefficient of $x^{i + j}$ in the product $ab$ is
      $$a_{i + j}b_0 + a_{i + j- 1}b_1 + \cdots + a_{i + 1}b_{j - 1} + a_ib_j +
        a_{i - 1}b_{j + 1} + \cdots + a_0b_{i + j}.$$
      By minimality of $a_i$ and $a_j$, it follows that
      $$b_0 = b_1 = \cdots = b_{j - 1} = a_{i - 1} = \cdots = a_0 = 0,$$
      so that the coefficient of $x^{i + j}$ in $ab$ is $a_ib_j$. Since $a_i$
      and $b_j$ are both nonzero elements of the integral domain $R$, it follows
      that $a_ib_j \neq 0$, so that $ab \neq 0$; thus $R[[x]]$ is an integral
      domain. \qed

         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $a \in F((x))$ be a nonzero element; thus,
               there exists an integer $M$ such that
               $a = \sum_{n \ge M}^\infty a_nx^n$, where $M$ is the smallest
               integer such that $a_M \neq 0$. That is, $a_M$ is a unit in $F$,
               so that $b = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{M+n}x^n$ is a unit by Exercise
               7.2.3(c). But $a = x^Mb$, so that $x^{-M}b^{-1}$ is the inverse
               of $a$, and thus, $a$ is a unit in $F((x))$. We conclude that
               $F((x))$ is a field. \qed
         \item \textbf{Proof.}

               \textit{$\nu$ is a discrete valuation}.

               \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textit{$\nu$ is a homomorphism}. Let
                        $a = \sum_{n \ge M}^\infty a_nx^n,
                         b = \sum_{n \ge N}^\infty b_nx^n \in F((x))^\times$,
                        where $N$ and $M$ are the order of zero of $a$ and $b$.
                        The coefficient of $x^{M+N}$ in $ab$ is $a_Mb_N$, a
                        nonzero element of $F$ because $a_M \neq 0$ and
                        $b_N \neq 0$. Consider an integer $i < M + N$.
                        The coefficient of $x^i$ in $ab$ is
                        $$\sum_{r+s=i}a_rb_s = \sum_{r\in\Z}a_rb_{i-r} =
                          \sum_{r=M}^\infty a_rb_{i-r}.$$
                        Now consider $b_{i - r}$ for some $r \ge M$. The
                        inequality $r \ge M$ implies that $i - r \le i - M$, and
                        since $i < M + N$ by assumption, it follows that
                        $i - r \le i - M < N$. Thus $b_{i - r} = 0$ since
                        $b_j = 0$ for all $j < N$. It follows that the
                        coefficient of $x^i$ is 0 for all $i < M + N$. Thus the
                        order of zero of $ab$ is $N + M$. Hence
                        $$\nu(ab) = M + N = \nu(a) + \nu(b),$$
                        so that $\nu$ is a homorphism.
                  \item \textit{$\nu$ is surjective}. For $z \in Z$, we have
                        that
                        $$\nu\left(\sum_{n \ge z}^\infty x^n\right) = z,$$
                        so that $\nu$ is onto.
                  \item $\nu(a + b) \ge \min\{\nu(a), \nu(b)$\}, $a + b \neq 0$,
                        \textit{ and } $a, b \in F((x))$. Let
                        $$a = \sum_{n \ge M}^\infty a_nx^n \text{ and }
                         b = \sum_{n \ge N}^\infty b_nx^n \in F((x))^\times,$$
                        where $a + b \neq 0$. We have $\nu(a) = N$ and
                        $\nu(b) = M$. Assume without loss of generality that
                        $M \le N$, so that $a_i = b_i$ for every $i < M$; i.e.,
                        $a_i + b_i = 0$ for every $i < M$, so that the order of
                        zero of $a + b$ is at least $M$; in order words
                        $$\nu(a + b) \ge M = \{\nu(a), \nu(b)\}.$$
               \end{itemize}
               The above shows that $\nu$ is a discrete valuation on $F((x))$.
               Let $R$ be the discrete valuation ring of $\nu$. Since the order
               of zero of every nonzero formal power series in $F[[x]]$ is at
               least 0 and since $0 \in F[[x]]$, it follows that
               $F[[x]] \subseteq R$. Conversely, the order of zero of every
               nonzero formal Laurent series in $R$ is at least 0, so that every
               nonzero Laurent series in $R$ is a power series. It follows that
               $F[[x]] \supseteq R$ and we conclude that $R = F[[x]]$. \qed
