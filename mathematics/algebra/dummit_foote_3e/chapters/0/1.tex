   \item[0.1.5] Determine whether the following functions $f$ are well defined:
                \begin{enumerate}
                   \item $f : \Q \rightarrow \Z$ defined by $f(a/b) = a$.
                   \item $f : \Q \rightarrow \Q$ defined by $f(a/b) = a^2/b^2$.
                \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution:}
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item $f$ is not well defined because $4/1 = 8/2$, but
                  $f(4/1) = 4 \neq 8 = f(8/2)$.
            \item We claim that $f$ is well defined.

                  \textbf{Proof.} We want to show that all representatives for 
                  an element in $\Q$ have the same output under $f$. So let
                  $a/b \in \Q$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Suppose $m \in \Q$ such 
                  that $m = a/b$. Then we must have that $m = ka/kb$ where $k$ 
                  is some nonzero integer. It follows that
                  $f(ka/kb) = k^2a^2/k^2b^2 = a^2/b^2 = f(a/b)$. \qed

      \textbf{Proof.} The map $f$ is not well defined because we have

      $f(0.\overline{9}) = 9 \neq 0 = f(1.\overline{0})$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob0.1.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[0.1.7] Let $f : A \rightarrow B$ be a surjective map of sets. Prove
                that the relation
                $$a \sim b \mbox{ if and only if } f(a) = f(b)$$
                is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the
                fibers of $f$.

      \textbf{Proof.} We want to show that the relation $\sim$ is an equivalence
      relation on $A$. That is, we want to show that $\sim$ is reflexive,
      symmetric, and transitive on $A$. Thus
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item[\textit{Reflexivity}:]  Let $a \in A$. Since $f(a) = f(a)$, it
                                       follows that $a \sim a$, so that $\sim$ 
                                       is reflexive on $A$.
         \item[\textit{Symmetry}:]     Let $a, b \in A$ with $a \sim b$. Since
                                       $a \sim b$, we must have that
                                       $f(a) = f(b)$; it immediately follows    
                                       that $f(b) = f(a)$, so that $b \sim a$;
                                       that is, $\sim$ is symmetric on $A$.
         \item[\textit{Transitivity}:] Let $a, b, c \in A$ with $a \sim b$ and
                                       $b \sim c$. Thus by definition, we have
                                       that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $f(b) = f(a)$. By
                                       transitivity of the equality relation it
                                       follows that $f(a) = f(c)$, so that
                                       $a \sim c$. Thus $\sim$ is transitive on
                                       $A$.
      \end{enumerate}

      Now we must show that the fibers of $f$ are the equivalence classes of
      $\sim$. So let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ 
      and let  $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of fibers of $f$. First we want to show
      that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$. So consider
      $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Let $h \in F$. Then we see that $\overline{h} = F$
      (because if $h' \in \overline{h}$ then $f(h') = f(h)$, so that $h' \in F$,
      and $\overline{h} \subseteq F$. Also if $g \in F$, then $f(h) = f(g)$ so  
      that $f \in \overline{h}$ and $F \subseteq \overline{h}$), so that $F \in
      \mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$. Now we want to show
      that $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ to complete the proof. Suppose
      $C \in \mathcal{C}$. Let $c \in C$. Then $C$ is the fiber of $f(c)$. Thus
      $C \in \mathcal{F}$ so that $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$. Since
      $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ and
      $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$, we must have that
      $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{F}$. \qed

                         $g : B \rightarrow A$ such that $f \circ g$ is the
                         identity map on $B$ and $g \circ f$ is the identity map
                         on $A$.
                   \item If $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with the same number of

                         surjective.
                \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Proof.}
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose first that the map $f : A \rightarrow B$ 
               has a left inverse, say $g : B \rightarrow A$. We want to show 
               that $f$ has is injective. So consider $a, b \in A$ such that
               $f(a) = f(b)$. Then we have that $g(f(a)) = g(f(b))$ so that
               $a = b$ since $g$ is a left inverse of $f$. Thus $f$ is
               injective. \\
               ($\Rightarrow$) Now suppose that $f$ is injective. Then we must 
               show that $f$ has	a left inverse. Notice that since $f$ is 
               injective, it must be the case that for every $b'' \in f(A)$ 
               there exists a unique $a'' \in A$ such that $f(a'') = b''$. Let 
               $a'$ be any member of $A$ and consider the map
	            $$g : B \rightarrow A,$$
	            where for every $b \in B$, we have
	            \begin{equation*}
		            g(b) = \left\{
			            \begin{array}{ll}
				            a & \text{if } b \in f(A) \text{ and where } f(a) = b,\\
                        a' & \text{if } b \in B\setminus f(A).
                     \end{array} \right.
               \end{equation*}
   
               So $(g \circ f)(a_1) = g(f(a_1)) = a_1$ for all $a_1 \in A$.
               Hence $g \circ f$ is the identity function on $A$, so that $g$ is
               a left inverse of $f$.

         \item $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $f$ has a right inverse, say
               $g : B \rightarrow A$. We must now show that $f$ is also 
               surjective; so let $b \in B$. Then, by supposition, we have that 
               $f(g(b)) = b$. Thus $f$ maps $g(b)$---a member of $A$---to $b$, 
               so that $f$ is onto.
   
               $(\Rightarrow)$ Now suppose that $f$ is surjective. We now want 
               to show that $f$ has a right inverse. Let $b \in B$. Since the 
               surjectivity of $f$ guarantees that the fiber of $\{b\}$ over $f$
               is not empty, we let $h : B \rightarrow A$ be a function that 
               maps an element $b \in B$ to some element in the fiber of $\{b\}$
               over $f$. Clearly if $c \in B$, then $f(h(c)) = c$, so that $h$ 
               is a right inverse of $f$.
         \item $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $g$ is a left and right inverse of
               $f$. Then by 1 and 2, $f$ is an injection and a surjection, so 
               that $f$ is a bijection.
   
               $(\Rightarrow)$ Now suppose that $f$ is a bijection. Let
               $b \in B$. We notice that the fiber of $\{b\}$ under $f$ is not 
               empty since $f$ is surjecitive, and this fiber contains exactly 
               one element of $A$. The latter is so since if $a_1, a_2$ are in 
               the fiber of $\{b\}$ over $f$, then $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ so that 
               $a_1 = a_2$ by the injectivity of $f$. So let $g$ be the map
               $g : B \rightarrow A$ that maps $c \in B$ to the only element in 
               the fiber of $\{c\}$ over $f$. It is trivial to show that $g$ is 
               both a left and right inverse of $f$.

         \item Let $|A| = |B| = n \in \Z^+$. First we shall assume that $f$ is
               bijective. It immediately follows that $f$ is injective. Now 
               assume that $f$ is injective. Since $f$ is one to one, no two 
               elements of $A$ map to the same element in $B$. This implies that
               $f(A)$ must contain exactly $n$ elements since $A$ contains $n$ 
               elements. But $|B| = n$, so that $f(A) = B$. That is, $f$ is 
               surjective. Now suppose that $f$ is surjective. Since $f$ is
               surjective, none of its fibers is empty; thus, the number of
               fibers of $f$ must equal $|B| = n$. We shall argue by    
               contradiction that $f$ is injective. So suppose that $f$ is not
               injective. Let $f_1$, $f_2$, $\ldots$, $f_n$ be the $n$ fibers of
               $f$. Since $f$ is not injective, one of this fibers must contain
               more than 1 element. so assume without loss of generality that
               $|f_1| \ge 2$. Since these fibers are a partition of $A$ and
               since each fiber contains at least one element it follows that
               \begin{align*}
                  |A| &= |f_1| + |f_2| + \cdots + |f_n| \\
                      &\ge 2 + (n - 1) \\
                      &\ge n + 1,
               \end{align*}
               a contradiction since $|A| = n$. Thus $f$ is injective.
