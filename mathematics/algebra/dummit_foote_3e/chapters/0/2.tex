      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  20 &= 1 \cdot 13 + 7 \\
                  13 &= 1 \cdot 7 + 6 \\
                  7  &= 1 \cdot 6 + 1, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                  1  &= 7 - 1 \cdot 6 \\
                     &= 7 - 1 \cdot (13 - 1 \cdot 7) \\
                     &= 2 \cdot 7 - 1 \cdot 13 \\
                     &= 2 \cdot (20 - 1 \cdot 13) - 1 \cdot 13 \\
                     &= 2 \cdot 20 - 3 \cdot 13.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(20, 13) = 1$ and we have $x = 2$ and $y = -3$.
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  69  &= 0 \cdot 372 + 69 \\
                  372 &= 5 \cdot 69 + 27 \\
                  69  &= 2 \cdot 27 + 15 \\
                  27  &= 1 \cdot 15 + 12 \\
                  15  &= 1 \cdot 12 + 3 \\
                  12  &= 4 \cdot 3 + 0, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                   3 &= 15 - 1 \cdot 12 \\
                     &= 15 - 1 \cdot (27 - 1 \cdot 15) \\
                     &= 2 \cdot 15 - 1 \cdot 27 \\
                     &= 2 \cdot (69 - 2 \cdot 27) - 1 \cdot 27 \\
                     &= 2 \cdot 69 - 5 \cdot 27 \\
                     &= 2 \cdot 69 - 5 \cdot (372 - 5 \cdot 69) \\
                     &= 27 \cdot 69 - 5 \cdot 372 \\
                     &= 27 \cdot 69 - 5 \cdot 372.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(69, 372) = 1$ and we have $x = 27$ and $y = -5$.
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  792 &= 2 \cdot 275 + 242 \\
                  275 &= 1 \cdot 242 + 33 \\
                  242 &= 7 \cdot 33 + 11 \\
                  33  &= 3 \cdot 11 + 0, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                  11  &= 242 - 7 \cdot 33 \\
                      &= 242 - 7 \cdot (275 - 1 \cdot 242) \\
                      &= 8 \cdot 242 - 7 \cdot 275 \\
                      &= 8 \cdot (792 - 2 \cdot 275) - 7 \cdot 275 \\
                      &= 8 \cdot 792 - 23 \cdot 275.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(792, 275) = 11$ and we have $x = 8$ and $y = -23$.
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  11391 &= 2 \cdot 5673 + 45 \\
                  5673  &= 126 \cdot 45 + 3 \\
                  45    &= 3 \cdot 15 + 0, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                  3     &= 5673 - 126 \cdot 45 \\
                        &= 5673 - 126 \cdot (11391 - 2 \cdot 5673) \\
                        &= -126 \cdot 11391 + 253 \cdot 5673.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(11391, 5673) = 3$ and we have $x = -126$ and
               $y = 253$.
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  1761 &= 1 \cdot 1567 + 194 \\
                  1567 &= 8 \cdot 194 + 15 \\
                  194  &= 12 \cdot 15 + 14 \\
                  15   &= 1 \cdot 14 + 1, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                   1   &= 15 - 1 \cdot 14 \\
                       &= 15 - 1 \cdot (194 - 12 \cdot 15) \\
                       &= 13 \cdot 15 - 1 \cdot 194 \\
                       &= 13 \cdot (1567 - 8 \cdot 194) - 1 \cdot 194 \\
                       &= 13 \cdot 1567 - 105 \cdot 194 \\
                       &= 13 \cdot 1567 - 105 \cdot (1761 - 1 \cdot 1567) \\
                       &= 118 \cdot 1567 - 105 \cdot 1761.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(1761, 1567) = 1$ and we have $x = -105$ and $y = 118$.
         \item Using the Euclidean Algorithm we have
               \begin{align*}
                  507885 &= 8 \cdot 60808 + 21421 \\
                  60808  &= 2 \cdot 21421 + 17966 \\
                  21421  &= 1 \cdot 17966 + 3455 \\
                  17966  &= 5 \cdot 3455 +  691 \\
                  3455   &= 5 \cdot 691 + 0, \text{ so that } \\ \\
                  691    &= 17966 - 5 \cdot 3455 \\
                         &= 17966 - 5 \cdot (21421 - 1 \cdot 17966) \\
                         &= 6 \cdot 17966 - 5 \cdot 21421 \\
                         &= 6 \cdot (60808 - 2 \cdot 21421) - 5 \cdot 21421 \\
                         &= 6 \cdot 60808 - 17 \cdot 21421 \\
                         &= 6 \cdot 60808 - 17 \cdot (507885 - 8 \cdot 60808) \\
                         &= 142 \cdot 60808 - 17 \cdot 507885.
               \end{align*}

               Thus $\gcd(507885, 60808) = 691$ and we have $x = -17$ and
               $y = 142$.

   \item[0.2.2]   Prove that if the integer $k$ divides the integers $a$ and $b$
                  then $k$ divides $as + bt$ for every pair of integers $s$ and
                  $t$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Assume that $k$ divides
      $a$ and $b$. Consider any pair of integers $s$ and $t$. We want to show
      that $k$ also divides $as + bt$; that is, we must show that there exists
      some integer $m_1$ such that $as + bt = km_1$. Since $k$ divides $a$ and
      $b$, we must have that $a = km_2$ and $b = km_3$ for some integers $m_2$
      and $m_3$. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         as + bt &= km_2s + km_3t \\
                 &= k(m_2s + m_3t). 
      \end{align*}

      So take $m_1 = m_2s + m_3t$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob0.2.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[0.2.3]   Prove that if $n$ is composite then there are integers $a$ and
                  $b$ such that $n$ divides $ab$ but $n$ does not divide either
                  $a$ or $b$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $n > 1$ be a composite integer. Then $n = cd$, where
      $c$ and $d$ are integers greater than 1. Clearly, $n \mid cd$ because
      $n = cd$, but $n$ divides neither $c$ nor $d$, since they are both less
      than $n$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob0.2.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[0.2.4]   Let $a$, $b$ and $N$ be fixed integers with $a$ and $b$ 
                  nonzero and let $d = (a, b)$ be the greatest common divisor of
                  $a$ and $b$. Suppose $x_0$ and $y_0$ are particular solutions
                  to $ax + by = N$. Prove for any integer $t$ that the integers
                  $$x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t \qquad y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t$$
                  are also solutions to $ax + by = N$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $t$ be an integer, and let
		$$x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t \text{ and } y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t.$$
		Then we have
		\begin{align*}
			ax + by &= a\left(x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t\right) +
						  b\left(y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t\right) \\
					  &= ax_0 + by_0 \\
					  &= N,					  
		\end{align*}
		so that $x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t$ and $y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t$ are
		solutions to the equation $ax + by = N$.

   \item[0.2.6]   Prove the Well Ordering Principle of $\Z$ by induction and
                  prove the minimal element is unique.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $P$ be a nonempty subset of $\Z^+$. We want to show 
      that $P$ has a minimal element. So suppose by way of contradiction that
      $P$ does not have a minimal element. For a natural number $n$, let $S(n)$ 
      be the statement that $n$ is not a member of $P$. We now want to show that
      by Strong Induction that $S(n)$ holds for every natural number $n$. If 1
      is in $P$, then it would be the smallest member of $P$, contradicting our
      assumption that $P$ has no minimal element, so $1 \notin P$; hence $S(1)$ 
      is true. Now suppose that $S(j)$ is true for every natural number $j < k$,
      where $k$ is a natural number greater than 1. By our supposition, we know
      that every integer less than $k$ is not in $P$, so if $k$ is in $P$, it
      would be the minimal element of $P$, contradicting our assumption that $P$
      has no minimal element. Thus $S(k)$ is true. It follows by Mathematical
      Induction that $S(n)$ holds for every positive integer $n$. That is, $P$
      is empty, a contradiction. We can now conclude that $P$ has a minimal 
      element, say $p$. To show that $p$ is unique assume that $q$ is also a
      minimal element of $P$. By virtue of $p$ as a minimal element of $P$, we 
      have $p \le q$ and, by virtue of $q$ as a minimal element of $P$, we have
      $q \le p$, so that $p = q$. Hence the minimal element of $P$ is
      unique. \qed

                  integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 = pb^2$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $p$ be a prime number. Suppose by contradiction that 
      there exist nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 = pb^2$. We can
      further suppose that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. Since $a^2 = pb^2$,
      it follows that $a^2$ has $p$ as one of its prime factors, so that $a$
      also has $p$ as one of its prime factors. We can then write $a = pm$
      for some integer $m$. Substituting $a = pm$ in the equation $a^2 = pb^2$,
      will give us the equation $pm^2 = b^2$. We can similarly conclude that
      $b$ has $p$ as one of its prime factors, so that $\gcd(a, b) \ge p$, a
      contradiction. Thus there do not exist nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ such 
      that $a^2 = pb^2$. \qed

   \item[0.2.8]   Let $p$ be a prime, $n \in \Z^+$. Find a formula for the

                  greatest integer function).

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $p$ be a prime and let $n$ be a positive integer. The
      largest power of $p$ that divides $n!$, say $k$, is simply the number of 
      multiples of $p$ in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. Thus
      $k = \lfloor{n/p}\rfloor$, where $\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ is the greatest
      integer less than the real number $x$.

                  particular that $\varphi(n)$ tends to infinity as $n$ tends to
                  infinity.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $N \in \N$ and define
      $$S_N = \{n \in \N : \varphi(n) = N\}.$$
      
      We want to show that $S_N$ is finite. So it suffices to show that $S_N$ is
      bounded; i.e., there exists a positive integer $K$ such that $n < K$ for
      all $n \in S_N$. If $S_N$ is empty, then we are done, so assume that $S_N$
      is nonempty. Let $m \in S_N$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it
      follows that
      $$m = {p_1}^{c_1}{p_2}^{c_2}\cdots{p_s}^{c_s},$$
      where the $p_i$s are mutually distinct primes, $s$, and the $c_i$s are
      positive integers. Suppose one of the $p_i$s greater than $N + 1$, say
      $p_1$. Then

               \varphi({p_s}^{c_s}) \\
            &= (p_1 - 1)(p_2 - 1)\cdots(p_s-1){p_1}^{c_1-1}{p_2}^{c_2-1}

      a contradiction since $\varphi(m) = N$. So $p_i \le N + 1$, for 
      $1 \le i \le s$.
      Let $\varepsilon$ be a positive 
      number. To show that $\varphi(n)$ tends to infinity, we must find a
      natural number $K$ such that $\varphi(n) > \varepsilon$ for all $n \ge K$.
      Choose $K = \max\{M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_{\lceil\varepsilon \rceil}\}$,
      ($\lceil\varepsilon\rceil$ is the least integer greater than
      $\varepsilon$). So if $n \ge K$, we know that $\varphi(n)$ cannot be a
      member of $\{1, 2, \ldots, \lceil\varepsilon\rceil\}$; in particular, we
      have that $\varphi(n) > \lceil\varepsilon\rceil \ge \varepsilon$. \qed

   \item[0.2.11]  Prove that if $d$ divides $n$ then $\varphi(d)$ divides
                  $\varphi(n)$ where $\varphi$ denotes Euler's
                  $\varphi-$function.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $d$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $d \mid n$.
      We want to show that $\varphi(d) \mid \varphi(n)$. Let
      ${d_1}^{a_1}{d_2}^{a_2}\cdots{d_k}^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of
      $d$, where each $a_i$ is a positive integer and each $d_i$ is a unique
      prime. Since $d \mid n$, it follows that there exists an integer $m$ such
      that
      $$n = ({d_1}^{a_1}{d_2}^{a_2}\cdots{d_k}^{a_k})m.$$
      Now we shall factor out the maximum powers of each $d_i$ in $m$, so that 
      we can write
      $$m = ({d_1}^{c_1}{d_2}^{c_2}\cdots{d_k}^{c_k})m'$$
      where each $c_i$ is a nonnegative integer and $m'$ is an integer that is
      prime to ${d_1}^{c_1}{d_2}^{c_2}\cdots{d_k}^{c_k}$. Thus we have that
      $$n = ({d_1}^{b_1}{d_2}^{b_2}\cdots{d_k}^{b_k})m', \quad b_i = a_i + c_i$$
      so that
      \begin{align*}
         \varphi(n) &= \varphi({d_1}^{b_1}{d_2}^{b_2}\cdots{d_k}^{b_k}m') \\
                    &= \varphi({d_1}^{b_1}{d_2}^{b_2}\cdots{d_k}^{b_k})
                       \varphi(m') \\
                    &= {d_1}^{b_1 - 1}(d_1 - 1){d_2}^{b_2 - 1}(d_2 - 1)\cdots
                       {d_k}^{b_k - 1}(d_k - 1)\varphi(m') \\
                    &= {d_1}^{c_1}{d_1}^{a_1 - 1}(d_1 - 1)
                       {d_2}^{c_2}{d_2}^{a_2 - 1}(d_2 - 1)\cdots
                       {d_k}^{c_k}{d_k}^{a_k - 1}(d_k - 1)\varphi(m')\\
                    &= {d_1}^{c_1}{d_2}^{c_2}\cdots{d_k}^{c_k}\varphi(m')
                       {d_1}^{a_1 - 1}(d_1 - 1)
                       {d_2}^{a_2 - 1}(d_2 - 1)\cdots
                       {d_k}^{a_k - 1}(d_k - 1) \\
                    &= ({d_1}^{c_1}{d_2}^{c_2}\cdots{d_k}^{c_k}
                        \varphi(m'))\varphi(d),
      \end{align*}
      so that $\varphi(d) \mid \varphi(n)$. \qed
