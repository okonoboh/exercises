   \item[1.1] Mark each statement True or False. Justify each answer.
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item In order to be classified as a statement, a sentence must be
               true.
         \item Some statements are both true and false.
         \item When a statement $p$ is true, then its negation $\sim$$p$ is
               false.
         \item A statement and its negation may be both false.
         \item In mathematic logic, the word "or" has an inclusive meaning.
      \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution:} 

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item False. A sentence has to be either true or false in order to be
               classified as a statement.
         \item False. A statement has to exclusively be True or False, not both.
         \item True. If a statement $p$ is true, then $\sim$$p$ = not $p$ = not
               true = false.
         \item False. A statement and its negation always have different values.
         \item True. If $p$ and $q$ are mathematical statements, then $p$ or $q$
               means that at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true.

         \item In an implication $p \Rightarrow q$, statement $p$ is referred to
               as the proposition.
         \item The only case where $p \Rightarrow q$ is false is when $p$ is
               true and $q$ is false.
         \item ``If $p$, then $q$" is equivalent to ``$p$ whenever $q$."
         \item The negation of a conjuction is the disjunction of the negations
               of the individual parts.
         \item The negation $p \Rightarrow q$ is $q \Rightarrow p$.
      \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution:} 

      \begin{enumerate}
         \item False. The statement $p$ is referred to as the antecedent.
         \item True. The truth table for the statement $p \Rightarrow q$ shows
               that it is only false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.
         \item False. ``If $p$, then $q$" is equivalent to ``$q$ whenever $p$.",
               not ``$p$ whenever $q$."
         \item True. $\sim$$(p \land q) \Leftrightarrow$ $\sim$$p$
               $\lor \sim$$q$.
         \item False. The negation of $p \Rightarrow q$ is $p$ $\land \sim$$q$.
